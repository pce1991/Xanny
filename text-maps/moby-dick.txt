Why"][[1 7 18] "is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at"][[1 7 19] "some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a"][[1 7 20] "passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first"][[1 7 21] "told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the"][[1 7 22] "old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate"][[1 7 23] "deity, and own brother of Jove?

But that same image, we ourselves see"][[1 7 27] "in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of"][[1 7 28] "life; and this is the key to it all."][[1 8 1] "Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin"][[1 8 2] "to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,"][[1 8 3] "I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger."][[1 8 4] "For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is"][[1 8 5] "but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get"][[1 8 6] "sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy"][[1 8 7] "themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger;"][[1 8 8] "nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a"][[1 8 9] "Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction"][[1 8 10] "of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all"][[1 8 11] "honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind"][[1 8 12] "whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,"][[1 8 13] "without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not."][[1 8 14] "And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory"][[1 8 15] "in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow,"][[1 8 16] "I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously"][[1 8 17] "buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who"][[1 8 18] "will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled"][[1 8 19] "fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old"][[1 8 20] "Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the"][[1 8 21] "mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids."][[1 9 1] "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,"][[1 9 2] "plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head."][[1 9 3] "True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to"][[1 9 4] "spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort"][[1 9 5] "of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honour,"][[1 9 6] "particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the"][[1 9 7] "Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,"][[1 9 8] "if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been"][[1 9 9] "lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand"][[1 9 10] "in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a"][[1 9 11] "schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and"][[1 9 12] "the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in"][[1 9 13] "time."][[1 10 1] "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom"][[1 10 2] "and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,"][[1 10 3] "I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel"][[1 10 4] "Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and"][[1 10 5] "respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't"][[1 10 6] "a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may"][[1 10 7] "order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the"][[1 10 8] "satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is"][[1 10 9] "one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical"][[1 10 10] "or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is"][[1 10 11] "passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and"][[1 10 12] "be content."][[1 11 1] "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of"][[1 11 2] "paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single"][[1 11 3] "penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must"][[1 11 4] "pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying"][[1 11 5] "and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable"][[1 11 6] "infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEING"][[1 11 7] "PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man"][[1 11 8] "receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly"][[1 11 9] "believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account"][[1 11 10] "can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves"][[1 11 11] "to perdition!"][[1 12 1] "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome"][[1 12 2] "exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,"][[1 12 3] "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,"][[1 12 4] "if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the"][[1 12 5] "Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from"][[1 12 6] "the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not"][[1 12 7] "so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many"][[1 12 8] "other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it."][[1 12 9] "But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a"][[1 12 10] "merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling"][[1 12 11] "voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the"][[1 12 12] "constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me"][[1 12 13] "in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And,"][[1 12 14] "doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand"][[1 12 15] "programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as"][[1 12 16] "a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances."][[1 12 17] "I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:"][[1 14 1] "\"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES."][[1 15 1] "\"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL."][[1 16 1] "\"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\""][[1 18 1] "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the"][[1 18 2] "Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others"][[1 18 3] "were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and"][[1 18 4] "easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though"][[1 18 5] "I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the"][[1 18 6] "circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives"][[1 18 7] "which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced"][[1 18 8] "me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the"][[1 18 9] "delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill"][[1 18 10] "and discriminating judgment."][[1 19 1] "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great"][[1 19 2] "whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my"][[1 19 3] "curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island"][[1 19 4] "bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all"][[1 19 5] "the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped"][[1 19 6] "to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not"][[1 19 7] "have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting"][[1 19 8] "itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on"][[1 19 9] "barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a"][[1 19 10] "horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it"][[1 19 11] "is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place"][[1 19 12] "one lodges in."][[1 20 1] "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the"][[1 20 2] "great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild"][[1 20 3] "conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into"][[1 20 4] "my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them"][[1 20 5] "all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air."][[2 0 0] "CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag."][[2 2 1] "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,"][[2 2 2] "and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of"][[2 2 3] "old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in"][[2 2 4] "December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet"][[2 2 5] "for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place"][[2 2 6] "would offer, till the following Monday."][[2 3 1] "As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at"][[2 3 2] "this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well"][[2 3 3] "be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was"][[2 3 4] "made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a"][[2 3 5] "fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous"][[2 3 6] "old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has"][[2 3 7] "of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though"][[2 3 8] "in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket"][[2 3 9] "was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the"][[2 3 10] "first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket"][[2 3 11] "did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to"][[2 3 12] "give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that"][[2 3 13] "first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported"][[2 3 14] "cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to"][[2 3 15] "discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?"][[2 4 1] "Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me"][[2 4 2] "in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a"][[2 4 3] "matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a"][[2 4 4] "very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold"][[2 4 5] "and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had"][[2 4 6] "sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So,"][[2 4 7] "wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of"][[2 4 8] "a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the"][[2 4 9] "north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you"][[2 4 10] "may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire"][[2 4 11] "the price, and don't be too particular."][[2 5 1] "With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The"][[2 5 2] "Crossed Harpoons\"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further"][[2 5 3] "on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\" there came such"][[2 5 4] "fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from"][[2 5 5] "before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches"][[2 5 6] "thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck"][[2 5 7] "my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless"][[2 5 8] "service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too"][[2 5 9] "expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the"][[2 5 10] "broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses"][[2 5 11] "within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away"][[2 5 12] "from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I"][[2 5 13] "went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for"][[2 5 14] "there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns."][[2 6 1] "Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,"][[2 6 2] "and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At"][[2 6 3] "this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of"][[2 6 4] "the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light"][[2 6 5] "proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly"][[2 6 6] "open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the"][[2 6 7] "public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an"][[2 6 8] "ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost"][[2 6 9] "choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But \"The"][[2 6 10] "Crossed Harpoons,\" and \"The Sword-Fish?\"--this, then must needs be the"][[2 6 11] "sign of \"The Trap.\" However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice"][[2 6 12] "within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door."][[2 7 1] "It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black"][[2 7 2] "faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel"][[2 7 3] "of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the"][[2 7 4] "preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and"][[2 7 5] "wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,"][[2 7 6] "Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'"][[2 8 1] "Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,"][[2 8 2] "and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging"][[2 8 3] "sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing"][[2 8 4] "a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--\"The"][[2 8 5] "Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.\""][[2 9 1] "Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought"][[2 9 2] "I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this"][[2 9 3] "Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and"][[2 9 4] "the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little"][[2 9 5] "wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from"][[2 9 6] "the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a"][[2 9 7] "poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very"][[2 9 8] "spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee."][[2 10 1] "It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied"][[2 10 2] "as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,"][[2 10 3] "where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever"][[2 10 4] "it did about poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a"][[2 10 5] "mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob"][[2 10 6] "quietly toasting for bed. \"In judging of that tempestuous wind called"][[2 10 7] "Euroclydon,\" says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy"][[2 10 8] "extant--\"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at"][[2 10 9] "it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether"][[2 10 10] "thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both"][[2 10 11] "sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.\" True enough,"][[2 10 12] "thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou"][[2 10 13] "reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is"][[2 10 14] "the house. What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies"][[2 10 15] "though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it's too late"][[2 10 16] "to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone"][[2 10 17] "is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus"][[2 10 18] "there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and"][[2 10 19] "shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears"][[2 10 20] "with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not"][[2 10 21] "keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his"][[2 10 22] "red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What"][[2 10 23] "a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them"][[2 10 24] "talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give"][[2 10 25] "me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals."][[2 11 1] "But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up"][[2 11 2] "to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra"][[2 11 3] "than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the"][[2 11 4] "line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in"][[2 11 5] "order to keep out this frost?"][[2 12 1] "Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the"][[2 12 2] "door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be"][[2 12 3] "moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a"][[2 12 4] "Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a"][[2 12 5] "temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans."][[2 13 1] "But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is"][[2 13 2] "plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,"][[2 13 3] "and see what sort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be."][[3 0 0] "CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn."][[3 2 1] "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,"][[3 2 2] "low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of"][[3 2 3] "the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large"][[3 2 4] "oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the"][[3 2 5] "unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent"][[3 2 6] "study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of"][[3 2 7] "the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its"][[3 2 8] "purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first"][[3 2 9] "you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New"][[3 2 10] "England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint"][[3 2 11] "of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and"][[3 2 12] "especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the"][[3 2 13] "entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however"][[3 2 14] "wild, might not be altogether unwarranted."][[3 3 1] "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,"][[3 3 2] "black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three"][[3 3 3] "blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,"][[3 3 4] "soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted."][[3 3 5] "Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable"][[3 3 6] "sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily"][[3 3 7] "took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting"][[3 3 8] "meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you"][[3 3 9] "through.--It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It's the unnatural"][[3 3 10] "combat of the four primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a"][[3 3 11] "Hyperborean winter scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream"][[3 3 12] "of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous"][[3 3 13] "something in the picture's midst. THAT once found out, and all the rest"][[3 3 14] "were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic"][[3 3 15] "fish? even the great leviathan himself?"][[3 4 1] "In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,"][[3 4 2] "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom"][[3 4 3] "I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a"][[3 4 4] "great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three"][[3 4 5] "dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to"][[3 4 6] "spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself"][[3 4 7] "upon the three mast-heads."][[3 5 1] "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish"][[3 5 2] "array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with"][[3 5 3] "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of"][[3 5 4] "human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round"][[3 5 5] "like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You"][[3 5 6] "shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage"][[3 5 7] "could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying"][[3 5 8] "implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons"][[3 5 9] "all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long"][[3 5 10] "lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen"][[3 5 11] "whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a"][[3 5 12] "corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,"][[3 5 13] "years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered"][[3 5 14] "nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a"][[3 5 15] "man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the"][[3 5 16] "hump."][[3 6 1] "Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut"][[3 6 2] "through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with"][[3 6 3] "fireplaces all round--you enter the public room. A still duskier place"][[3 6 4] "is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled"][[3 6 5] "planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's"][[3 6 6] "cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored"][[3 6 7] "old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like"][[3 6 8] "table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities"][[3 6 9] "gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks. Projecting from the"][[3 6 10] "further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude"][[3 6 11] "attempt at a right whale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the"][[3 6 12] "vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive"][[3 6 13] "beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,"][[3 6 14] "bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another"][[3 6 15] "cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little"][[3 6 16] "withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors"][[3 6 17] "deliriums and death."][[3 7 1] "Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though"][[3 7 2] "true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses"][[3 7 3] "deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians"][[3 7 4] "rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. Fill to"][[3 7 5] "THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so"][[3 7 6] "on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for"][[3 7 7] "a shilling."][[3 8 1] "Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about"][[3 8 2] "a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I"][[3 8 3] "sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a"][[3 8 4] "room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied."][[3 8 5] "\"But avast,\" he added, tapping his forehead, \"you haint no objections"][[3 8 6] "to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye? I s'pose you are goin'"][[3 8 7] "a-whalin', so you'd better get used to that sort of thing.\""][[3 9 1] "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should"][[3 9 2] "ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and"][[3 9 3] "that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the"][[3 9 4] "harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander"][[3 9 5] "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with"][[3 9 6] "the half of any decent man's blanket."][[3 10 1] "\"I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?--you want supper?"][[3 10 2] "Supper'll be ready directly.\""][[3 11 1] "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the"][[3 11 2] "Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with"][[3 11 3] "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space"][[3 11 4] "between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but"][[3 11 5] "he didn't make much headway, I thought."][[3 12 1] "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an"][[3 12 2] "adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord"][[3 12 3] "said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each"][[3 12 4] "in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and"][[3 12 5] "hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But"][[3 12 6] "the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,"][[3 12 7] "but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in"][[3 12 8] "a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful"][[3 12 9] "manner."][[3 13 1] "\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a dead"][[3 13 2] "sartainty.\""][[3 14 1] "\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\""][[3 15 1] "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the harpooneer"][[3 15 2] "is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don't--he eats"][[3 15 3] "nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\""][[3 16 1] "\"The devil he does,\" says I. \"Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?\""][[3 17 1] "\"He'll be here afore long,\" was the answer."][[3 18 1] "I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark"][[3 18 2] "complexioned\" harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so"][[3 18 3] "turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into"][[3 18 4] "bed before I did."][[3 19 1] "Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not"][[3 19 2] "what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening"][[3 19 3] "as a looker on."][[3 20 1] "Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord"][[3 20 2] "cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew. I seed her reported in the offing"][[3 20 3] "this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now"][[3 20 4] "we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.\""][[3 21 1] "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,"][[3 21 2] "and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy"][[3 21 3] "watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all"][[3 21 4] "bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an"][[3 21 5] "eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,"][[3 21 6] "and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they"][[3 21 7] "made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled"][[3 21 8] "little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all"][[3 21 9] "round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah"][[3 21 10] "mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a"][[3 21 11] "sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how"][[3 21 12] "long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the"][[3 21 13] "weather side of an ice-island."][[3 22 1] "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even"][[3 22 2] "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering"][[3 22 3] "about most obstreperously."][[3 23 1] "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though"][[3 23 2] "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own"][[3 23 3] "sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise"][[3 23 4] "as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods"][[3 23 5] "had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a"][[3 23 6] "sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will"][[3 23 7] "here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet"][[3 23 8] "in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have"][[3 23 9] "seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,"][[3 23 10] "making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep"][[3 23 11] "shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give"][[3 23 12] "him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,"][[3 23 13] "and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall"][[3 23 14] "mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry"][[3 23 15] "of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away"][[3 23 16] "unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the"][[3 23 17] "sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and"][[3 23 18] "being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised"][[3 23 19] "a cry of \"Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of"][[3 23 20] "the house in pursuit of him."][[3 24 1] "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost"][[3 24 2] "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself"][[3 24 3] "upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance"][[3 24 4] "of the seamen."][[3 25 1] "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal"][[3 25 2] "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but"][[3 25 3] "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to"][[3 25 4] "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange"][[3 25 5] "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely"][[3 25 6] "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should"][[3 25 7] "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep"][[3 25 8] "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they"][[3 25 9] "all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and"][[3 25 10] "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin."][[3 26 1] "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the"][[3 26 2] "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a"][[3 26 3] "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of"][[3 26 4] "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over."][[3 26 5] "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be"][[3 26 6] "home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at"][[3 26 7] "midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?"][[3 27 1] "\"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep"][[3 27 2] "with him. I'll try the bench here.\""][[3 28 1] "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a"][[3 28 2] "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots and"][[3 28 3] "notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane"][[3 28 4] "there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\" So saying"][[3 28 5] "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting"][[3 28 6] "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning"][[3 28 7] "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the"][[3 28 8] "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was"][[3 28 9] "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the"][[3 28 10] "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing"][[3 28 11] "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the"][[3 28 12] "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in"][[3 28 13] "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a"][[3 28 14] "brown study."][[3 29 1] "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too"][[3 29 2] "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too"][[3 29 3] "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher"][[3 29 4] "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them. I then placed the"][[3 29 5] "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,"][[3 29 6] "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I"][[3 29 7] "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under"][[3 29 8] "the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially"][[3 29 9] "as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,"][[3 29 10] "and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate"][[3 29 11] "vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night."][[3 30 1] "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal"][[3 30 2] "a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be"][[3 30 3] "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon"][[3 30 4] "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next"][[3 30 5] "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be"][[3 30 6] "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!"][[3 31 1] "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending"][[3 31 2] "a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think"][[3 31 3] "that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against"][[3 31 4] "this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping"][[3 31 5] "in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may"][[3 31 6] "become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling."][[3 32 1] "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,"][[3 32 2] "and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer."][[3 33 1] "\"Landlord!\" said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such"][[3 33 2] "late hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock."][[3 34 1] "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to"][[3 34 2] "be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he"][[3 34 3] "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to"][[3 34 4] "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out"][[3 34 5] "a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,"][[3 34 6] "unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\""][[3 35 1] "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you"][[3 35 2] "are telling me?\" getting into a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say,"][[3 35 3] "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday"][[3 35 4] "night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\""][[3 36 1] "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't"][[3 36 2] "sell it here, the market's overstocked.\""][[3 37 1] "\"With what?\" shouted I."][[3 38 1] "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\""][[3 39 1] "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better"][[3 39 2] "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\""][[3 40 1] "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I"][[3 40 2] "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a"][[3 40 3] "slanderin' his head.\""][[3 41 1] "\"I'll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this"][[3 41 2] "unaccountable farrago of the landlord's."][[3 42 1] "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he."][[3 43 1] "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\""][[3 44 1] "\"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\""][[3 45 1] "\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a"][[3 45 2] "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one"][[3 45 3] "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a"][[3 45 4] "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half"][[3 45 5] "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I"][[3 45 6] "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and"][[3 45 7] "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling"][[3 45 8] "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,"][[3 45 9] "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest"][[3 45 10] "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this"][[3 45 11] "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the"][[3 45 12] "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay"][[3 45 13] "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good"][[3 45 14] "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping"][[3 45 15] "with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying"][[3 45 16] "to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to"][[3 45 17] "a criminal prosecution.\""][[3 46 1] "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty long"][[3 46 2] "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,"][[3 46 3] "this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from"][[3 46 4] "the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads"][[3 46 5] "(great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one"][[3 46 6] "he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not"][[3 46 7] "do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to"][[3 46 8] "churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was"][[3 46 9] "goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the"][[3 46 10] "airth like a string of inions.\""][[3 47 1] "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed"][[3 47 2] "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at"][[3 47 3] "the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a"][[3 47 4] "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal"][[3 47 5] "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?"][[3 48 1] "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\""][[3 49 1] "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's getting dreadful"][[3 49 2] "late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me"][[3 49 3] "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room"][[3 49 4] "for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why,"][[3 49 5] "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the"][[3 49 6] "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and"][[3 49 7] "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm."][[3 49 8] "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a"][[3 49 9] "glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards"][[3 49 10] "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a"][[3 49 11] "clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that"][[3 49 12] "harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO"][[3 49 13] "come; WON'T ye come?\""][[3 50 1] "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was"][[3 50 2] "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,"][[3 50 3] "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers"][[3 50 4] "to sleep abreast."][[3 51 1] "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest"][[3 51 2] "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make"][[3 51 3] "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned round from"][[3 51 4] "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared."][[3 52 1] "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the"][[3 52 2] "most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced"][[3 52 3] "round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see"][[3 52 4] "no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four"][[3 52 5] "walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of"][[3 52 6] "things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed"][[3 52 7] "up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,"][[3 52 8] "containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk."][[3 52 9] "Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf"][[3 52 10] "over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed."][[3 53 1] "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the"][[3 53 2] "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive"][[3 53 3] "at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to"][[3 53 4] "nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little"][[3 53 5] "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an"][[3 53 6] "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,"][[3 53 7] "as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible"][[3 53 8] "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the"][[3 53 9] "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try"][[3 53 10] "it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and"][[3 53 11] "thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer"][[3 53 12] "had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass"][[3 53 13] "stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore"][[3 53 14] "myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck."][[3 54 1] "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this"][[3 54 2] "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on"][[3 54 3] "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in"][[3 54 4] "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought"][[3 54 5] "a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,"][[3 54 6] "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about"][[3 54 7] "the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very"][[3 54 8] "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and"][[3 54 9] "then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the"][[3 54 10] "care of heaven."][[3 55 1] "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,"][[3 55 2] "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep"][[3 55 3] "for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty"][[3 55 4] "nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy"][[3 55 5] "footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room"][[3 55 6] "from under the door."][[3 56 1] "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal"][[3 56 2] "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word"][[3 56 3] "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New"][[3 56 4] "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without"][[3 56 5] "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the"][[3 56 6] "floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords"][[3 56 7] "of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all"][[3 56 8] "eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while"][[3 56 9] "employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he"][[3 56 10] "turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of"][[3 56 11] "a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large"][[3 56 12] "blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible"][[3 56 13] "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,"][[3 56 14] "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face"][[3 56 15] "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be"][[3 56 16] "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were"][[3 56 17] "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;"][[3 56 18] "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of"][[3 56 19] "a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been"][[3 56 20] "tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his"][[3 56 21] "distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,"][[3 56 22] "thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any"][[3 56 23] "sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that"][[3 56 24] "part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the"][[3 56 25] "squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of"][[3 56 26] "tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man"][[3 56 27] "into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;"][[3 56 28] "and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the"][[3 56 29] "skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,"][[3 56 30] "this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty"][[3 56 31] "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled"][[3 56 32] "out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing"][[3 56 33] "these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New"][[3 56 34] "Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag."][[3 56 35] "He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out"][[3 56 36] "with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at"][[3 56 37] "least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His"][[3 56 38] "bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull."][[3 56 39] "Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted"][[3 56 40] "out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner."][[3 57 1] "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but"][[3 57 2] "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of"][[3 57 3] "this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension."][[3 57 4] "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and"][[3 57 5] "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him"][[3 57 6] "as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at"][[3 57 7] "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not"][[3 57 8] "game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer"][[3 57 9] "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him."][[3 58 1] "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed"][[3 58 2] "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered"][[3 58 3] "with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same"][[3 58 4] "dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just"][[3 58 5] "escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very"][[3 58 6] "legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up"][[3 58 7] "the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some"][[3 58 8] "abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South"][[3 58 9] "Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it."][[3 58 10] "A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might"][[3 58 11] "take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!"][[3 59 1] "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about"][[3 59 2] "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that"][[3 59 3] "he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or"][[3 59 4] "dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the"][[3 59 5] "pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with"][[3 59 6] "a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo"][[3 59 7] "baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that"][[3 59 8] "this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But"][[3 59 9] "seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal"][[3 59 10] "like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden"][[3 59 11] "idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the"][[3 59 12] "empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this"][[3 59 13] "little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The"][[3 59 14] "chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I"][[3 59 15] "thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel"][[3 59 16] "for his Congo idol."][[3 60 1] "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but"][[3 60 2] "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes"][[3 60 3] "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places"][[3 60 4] "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on"][[3 60 5] "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into"][[3 60 6] "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,"][[3 60 7] "and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be"][[3 60 8] "scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;"][[3 60 9] "then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of"][[3 60 10] "it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such"][[3 60 11] "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange"][[3 60 12] "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the"][[3 60 13] "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some"][[3 60 14] "pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the"][[3 60 15] "most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol"][[3 60 16] "up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as"][[3 60 17] "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock."][[3 61 1] "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and"][[3 61 2] "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business"][[3 61 3] "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,"][[3 61 4] "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which"][[3 61 5] "I had so long been bound."][[3 62 1] "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one."][[3 62 2] "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an"][[3 62 3] "instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,"][[3 62 4] "he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light"][[3 62 5] "was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,"][[3 62 6] "sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving"][[3 62 7] "a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me."][[3 63 1] "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him"][[3 63 2] "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might"][[3 63 3] "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his"][[3 63 4] "guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my"][[3 63 5] "meaning."][[3 64 1] "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\""][[3 64 2] "And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the"][[3 64 3] "dark."][[3 65 1] "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord! Watch!"][[3 65 2] "Coffin! Angels! save me!\""][[3 66 1] "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled the"][[3 66 2] "cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the"][[3 66 3] "hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire."][[3 66 4] "But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light"][[3 66 5] "in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him."][[3 67 1] "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here wouldn't"][[3 67 2] "harm a hair of your head.\""][[3 68 1] "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that that"][[3 68 2] "infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\""][[3 69 1] "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads"][[3 69 2] "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look"][[3 69 3] "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\""][[3 70 1] "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and"][[3 70 2] "sitting up in bed."][[3 71 1] "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and"][[3 71 2] "throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil"][[3 71 3] "but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment."][[3 71 4] "For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking"][[3 71 5] "cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to"][[3 71 6] "myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason"][[3 71 7] "to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober"][[3 71 8] "cannibal than a drunken Christian."][[3 72 1] "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or"][[3 72 2] "whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will"][[3 72 3] "turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me."][[3 72 4] "It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.\""][[3 73 1] "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely"][[3 73 2] "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to"][[3 73 3] "say--\"I won't touch a leg of ye.\""][[3 74 1] "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\""][[3 75 1] "I turned in, and never slept better in my life."][[4 0 0] "CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane."][[4 2 1] "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown"][[4 2 2] "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost"][[4 2 3] "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of"][[4 2 4] "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his"][[4 2 5] "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure,"][[4 2 6] "no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to"][[4 2 7] "his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt"][[4 2 8] "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I"][[4 2 9] "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt."][[4 2 10] "Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could"][[4 2 11] "hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and"][[4 2 12] "it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that"][[4 2 13] "Queequeg was hugging me."][[4 3 1] "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a"][[4 3 2] "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;"][[4 3 3] "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle."][[4 3 4] "The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other--I"][[4 3 5] "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little"][[4 3 6] "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,"][[4 3 7] "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my"][[4 3 8] "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to"][[4 3 9] "bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the st June,"][[4 3 10] "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But"][[4 3 11] "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the"][[4 3 12] "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,"][[4 3 13] "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets."][[4 4 1] "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse"][[4 4 2] "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the"][[4 4 3] "small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the"][[4 4 4] "sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the"][[4 4 5] "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse"][[4 4 6] "and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my"][[4 4 7] "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself"][[4 4 8] "at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good"][[4 4 9] "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie"][[4 4 10] "abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most"][[4 4 11] "conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For"][[4 4 12] "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I"][[4 4 13] "have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At"][[4 4 14] "last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly"][[4 4 15] "waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before"][[4 4 16] "sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock"][[4 4 17] "running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was"][[4 4 18] "to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung"][[4 4 19] "over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form"][[4 4 20] "or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my"][[4 4 21] "bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with"][[4 4 22] "the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking"][[4 4 23] "that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be"][[4 4 24] "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;"][[4 4 25] "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for"][[4 4 26] "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding"][[4 4 27] "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle"][[4 4 28] "myself with it."][[4 5 1] "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the"][[4 5 2] "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to"][[4 5 3] "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan"][[4 5 4] "arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly"][[4 5 5] "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to"][[4 5 6] "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his"][[4 5 7] "bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,"][[4 5 8] "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse"][[4 5 9] "him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,"][[4 5 10] "my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a"][[4 5 11] "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk"][[4 5 12] "sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A"][[4 5 13] "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the"][[4 5 14] "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \"Queequeg!--in the name of"][[4 5 15] "goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by dint of much wriggling, and"][[4 5 16] "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his"][[4 5 17] "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in"][[4 5 18] "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself"][[4 5 19] "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,"][[4 5 20] "stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he"][[4 5 21] "did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim"][[4 5 22] "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over"][[4 5 23] "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings"][[4 5 24] "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at"][[4 5 25] "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,"][[4 5 26] "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon"][[4 5 27] "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,"][[4 5 28] "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress"][[4 5 29] "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,"][[4 5 30] "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the"][[4 5 31] "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what"][[4 5 32] "you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this"][[4 5 33] "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much"][[4 5 34] "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;"][[4 5 35] "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for"][[4 5 36] "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,"][[4 5 37] "a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well"][[4 5 38] "worth unusual regarding."][[4 6 1] "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,"][[4 6 2] "by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots."][[4 6 3] "What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next"][[4 6 4] "movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;"][[4 6 5] "when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was"][[4 6 6] "hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever"][[4 6 7] "heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his"][[4 6 8] "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition"][[4 6 9] "stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized"][[4 6 10] "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His"][[4 6 11] "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not"][[4 6 12] "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled"][[4 6 13] "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,"][[4 6 14] "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At"][[4 6 15] "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his"][[4 6 16] "eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not"][[4 6 17] "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide"][[4 6 18] "ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented"][[4 6 19] "him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning."][[4 7 1] "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the"][[4 7 2] "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view"][[4 7 3] "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that"][[4 7 4] "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;"][[4 7 5] "I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,"][[4 7 6] "and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He"][[4 7 7] "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the"][[4 7 8] "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to"][[4 7 9] "my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his"][[4 7 10] "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a"][[4 7 11] "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water"][[4 7 12] "and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept"][[4 7 13] "his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,"][[4 7 14] "slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little"][[4 7 15] "on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,"][[4 7 16] "begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks"][[4 7 17] "I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance."][[4 7 18] "Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of"][[4 7 19] "what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp"][[4 7 20] "the long straight edges are always kept."][[4 8 1] "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of"][[4 8 2] "the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his"][[4 8 3] "harpoon like a marshal's baton."][[5 0 0] "CHAPTER 5. Breakfast."][[5 2 1] "I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the"][[5 2 2] "grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,"][[5 2 3] "though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my"][[5 2 4] "bedfellow."][[5 3 1] "However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a"][[5 3 2] "good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his own"][[5 3 3] "proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be"][[5 3 4] "backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in"][[5 3 5] "that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him,"][[5 3 6] "be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for."][[5 4 1] "The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the"][[5 4 2] "night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were"][[5 4 3] "nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and"][[5 4 4] "sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers,"][[5 4 5] "and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an"][[5 4 6] "unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns."][[5 5 1] "You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This"][[5 5 2] "young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and"][[5 5 3] "would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days"][[5 5 4] "landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades"][[5 5 5] "lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the"][[5 5 6] "complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached"][[5 5 7] "withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show"][[5 5 8] "a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the"][[5 5 9] "Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates,"][[5 5 10] "zone by zone."][[5 6 1] "\"Grub, ho!\" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went"][[5 6 2] "to breakfast."][[5 7 1] "They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease"][[5 7 2] "in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard,"][[5 7 3] "the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all"][[5 7 4] "men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the"][[5 7 5] "mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or"][[5 7 6] "the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart"][[5 7 7] "of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances--this kind of"][[5 7 8] "travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social"][[5 7 9] "polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had"][[5 7 10] "anywhere."][[5 8 1] "These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that"][[5 8 2] "after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some"][[5 8 3] "good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every"][[5 8 4] "man maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked"][[5 8 5] "embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the"][[5 8 6] "slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire"][[5 8 7] "strangers to them--and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here"][[5 8 8] "they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of"][[5 8 9] "kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they"][[5 8 10] "had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains."][[5 8 11] "A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!"][[5 9 1] "But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head of"][[5 9 2] "the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot"][[5 9 3] "say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially"][[5 9 4] "justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it"][[5 9 5] "there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent"][[5 9 6] "jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But"][[5 9 7] "THAT was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that in"][[5 9 8] "most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly."][[5 10 1] "We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he eschewed"][[5 10 2] "coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,"][[5 10 3] "done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the"][[5 10 4] "rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting"][[5 10 5] "there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I"][[5 10 6] "sallied out for a stroll."][[6 0 0] "CHAPTER 6. The Street."][[6 2 1] "If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish"][[6 2 2] "an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a"][[6 2 3] "civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first"][[6 2 4] "daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford."][[6 3 1] "In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will"][[6 3 2] "frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign"][[6 3 3] "parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners"][[6 3 4] "will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not"][[6 3 5] "unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live"][[6 3 6] "Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water"][[6 3 7] "Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors;"][[6 3 8] "but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners;"][[6 3 9] "savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It"][[6 3 10] "makes a stranger stare."][[6 4 1] "But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,"][[6 4 2] "and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft"][[6 4 3] "which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still"][[6 4 4] "more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town"][[6 4 5] "scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain"][[6 4 6] "and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;"][[6 4 7] "fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch"][[6 4 8] "the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they"][[6 4 9] "came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look"][[6 4 10] "there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and"][[6 4 11] "swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here"][[6 4 12] "comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak."][[6 5 1] "No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a"][[6 5 2] "downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his"][[6 5 3] "two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a"][[6 5 4] "country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished"][[6 5 5] "reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the"][[6 5 6] "comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his"][[6 5 7] "sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his"][[6 5 8] "canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps"][[6 5 9] "in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and"][[6 5 10] "all, down the throat of the tempest."][[6 6 1] "But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and"][[6 6 2] "bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer"][[6 6 3] "place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this"][[6 6 4] "day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador."][[6 6 5] "As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they"][[6 6 6] "look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live"][[6 6 7] "in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like"][[6 6 8] "Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with"][[6 6 9] "milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in"][[6 6 10] "spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like"][[6 6 11] "houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came"][[6 6 12] "they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?"][[6 7 1] "Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty"][[6 7 2] "mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses"][[6 7 3] "and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans."][[6 7 4] "One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom"][[6 7 5] "of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?"][[6 8 1] "In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their"][[6 8 2] "daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece."][[6 8 3] "You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,"][[6 8 4] "they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly"][[6 8 5] "burn their lengths in spermaceti candles."][[6 9 1] "In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long"][[6 9 2] "avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and"][[6 9 3] "bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their"][[6 9 4] "tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;"][[6 9 5] "which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces"][[6 9 6] "of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final"][[6 9 7] "day."][[6 10 1] "And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But"][[6 10 2] "roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks"][[6 10 3] "is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that"][[6 10 4] "bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young"][[6 10 5] "girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off"][[6 10 6] "shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of"][[6 10 7] "the Puritanic sands."][[7 0 0] "CHAPTER 7. The Chapel."][[7 2 1] "In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few are"][[7 2 2] "the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who"][[7 2 3] "fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not."][[7 3 1] "Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this"][[7 3 2] "special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving"][[7 3 3] "sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called"][[7 3 4] "bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I"][[7 3 5] "found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors' wives and"][[7 3 6] "widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks"][[7 3 7] "of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from"][[7 3 8] "the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The"][[7 3 9] "chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and"][[7 3 10] "women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders,"][[7 3 11] "masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran"][[7 3 12] "something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:--"][[7 4 1] "SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was"][[7 4 2] "lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November"][[7 4 3] "st, .

THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW."][[7 7 1] "Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself"][[7 7 2] "near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near"][[7 7 3] "me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze"][[7 7 4] "of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only"][[7 7 5] "person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only"][[7 7 6] "one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid"][[7 7 7] "inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen"][[7 7 8] "whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;"][[7 7 9] "but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly"][[7 7 10] "did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings"][[7 7 11] "of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were"][[7 7 12] "assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak"][[7 7 13] "tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh."][[7 8 1] "Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among"][[7 8 2] "flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation"][[7 8 3] "that broods in bosoms like these.

What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in"][[7 8 6] "the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to"][[7 8 7] "the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might"][[7 8 8] "those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here."][[7 9 1] "In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;"][[7 9 2] "why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no"][[7 9 3] "tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is"][[7 9 4] "that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix"][[7 9 5] "so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if"][[7 9 6] "he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the"][[7 9 7] "Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what"][[7 9 8] "eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies"][[7 9 9] "antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we"][[7 9 10] "still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are"][[7 9 11] "dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all"][[7 9 12] "the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a"][[7 9 13] "whole city.

Delightful inducements to embark, fine"][[7 11 6] "chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an"][[7 11 7] "immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a"][[7 11 8] "speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what"][[7 11 9] "then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death."][[7 11 10] "Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true"][[7 11 11] "substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too"][[7 11 12] "much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that"][[7 11 13] "thick water the thinnest of air.

The Pulpit."][[8 2 1] "I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable"][[8 2 2] "robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon"][[8 2 3] "admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,"][[8 2 4] "sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it"][[8 2 5] "was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he"][[8 2 6] "was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his"][[8 2 7] "youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry."][[8 2 8] "At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a"][[8 2 9] "healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second"][[8 2 10] "flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone"][[8 2 11] "certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure"][[8 2 12] "peeping forth even beneath February's snow. No one having previously"][[8 2 13] "heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without"][[8 2 14] "the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical"][[8 2 15] "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life"][[8 2 16] "he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and"][[8 2 17] "certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down"][[8 2 18] "with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to"][[8 2 19] "drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed."][[8 2 20] "However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up"][[8 2 21] "in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit,"][[8 2 22] "he quietly approached the pulpit."][[8 3 1] "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a"][[8 3 2] "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,"][[8 3 3] "seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect,"][[8 3 4] "it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the"][[8 3 5] "pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like"][[8 3 6] "those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling"][[8 3 7] "captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted"][[8 3 8] "man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and"][[8 3 9] "stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what"][[8 3 10] "manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for"][[8 3 11] "an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the"][[8 3 12] "ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards,"][[8 3 13] "and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand"][[8 3 14] "over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel."][[8 4 1] "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with"][[8 4 2] "swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,"][[8 4 3] "so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the"][[8 4 4] "pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,"][[8 4 5] "these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not"][[8 4 6] "prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn"][[8 4 7] "round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder"][[8 4 8] "step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him"][[8 4 9] "impregnable in his little Quebec."][[8 5 1] "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this."][[8 5 2] "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,"][[8 5 3] "that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks"][[8 5 4] "of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this"][[8 5 5] "thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be,"][[8 5 6] "then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual"][[8 5 7] "withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?"][[8 5 8] "Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful"][[8 5 9] "man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold--a lofty"][[8 5 10] "Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls."][[8 6 1] "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,"][[8 6 2] "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings. Between the marble"][[8 6 3] "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back"][[8 6 4] "was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating"][[8 6 5] "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy"][[8 6 6] "breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there"][[8 6 7] "floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's"][[8 6 8] "face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the"][[8 6 9] "ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into"][[8 6 10] "the Victory's plank where Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\" the angel"][[8 6 11] "seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy"][[8 6 12] "helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling"][[8 6 13] "off--serenest azure is at hand.\""][[8 7 1] "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that"][[8 7 2] "had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in"][[8 7 3] "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a"][[8 7 4] "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed"][[8 7 5] "beak."][[8 8 1] "What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth's"][[8 8 2] "foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the"][[8 8 3] "world. From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is first"][[8 8 4] "descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is"][[8 8 5] "the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds."][[8 8 6] "Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;"][[8 8 7] "and the pulpit is its prow."][[9 0 0] "CHAPTER 9. The Sermon."][[9 2 1] "Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered"][[9 2 2] "the scattered people to condense. \"Starboard gangway, there! side away"][[9 2 3] "to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!\""][[9 3 1] "There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a"][[9 3 2] "still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again, and"][[9 3 3] "every eye on the preacher."][[9 4 1] "He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his large"][[9 4 2] "brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered"][[9 4 3] "a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the"][[9 4 4] "bottom of the sea."][[9 5 1] "This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of"][[9 5 2] "a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he"][[9 5 3] "commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards"][[9 5 4] "the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--"][[9 6 1] "\"The ribs and terrors in the whale,"][[9 6 2] "Arched over me a dismal gloom,"][[9 6 3] "While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,"][[9 6 4] "And lift me deepening down to doom."][[9 7 1] "\"I saw the opening maw of hell,"][[9 7 2] "With endless pains and sorrows there;"][[9 7 3] "Which none but they that feel can tell--"][[9 7 4] "Oh, I was plunging to despair."][[9 8 1] "\"In black distress, I called my God,"][[9 8 2] "When I could scarce believe him mine,"][[9 8 3] "He bowed his ear to my complaints--"][[9 8 4] "No more the whale did me confine."][[9 9 1] "\"With speed he flew to my relief,"][[9 9 2] "As on a radiant dolphin borne;"][[9 9 3] "Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone"][[9 9 4] "The face of my Deliverer God."][[9 10 1] "\"My song for ever shall record"][[9 10 2] "That terrible, that joyful hour;"][[9 10 3] "I give the glory to my God,"][[9 10 4] "His all the mercy and the power.\""][[9 12 1] "Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the"][[9 12 2] "howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned"][[9 12 3] "over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon"][[9 12 4] "the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the"][[9 12 5] "first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up"][[9 12 6] "Jonah.'\""][[9 13 1] "\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is one"][[9 13 2] "of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what"][[9 13 3] "depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a pregnant"][[9 13 4] "lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the"][[9 13 5] "fish's belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods"][[9 13 6] "surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;"][[9 13 7] "sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But WHAT is this"][[9 13 8] "lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded"][[9 13 9] "lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot"][[9 13 10] "of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it"][[9 13 11] "is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the"][[9 13 12] "swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and"][[9 13 13] "joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of"][[9 13 14] "Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never"][[9 13 15] "mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard"][[9 13 16] "command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to"][[9 13 17] "do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to"][[9 13 18] "persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in"][[9 13 19] "this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists."][[9 14 1] "\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at"][[9 14 2] "God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will"][[9 14 3] "carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains"][[9 14 4] "of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship"][[9 14 5] "that's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded"][[9 14 6] "meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city"][[9 14 7] "than the modern Cadiz. That's the opinion of learned men. And where is"][[9 14 8] "Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,"][[9 14 9] "as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the"][[9 14 10] "Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa,"][[9 14 11] "shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the"][[9 14 12] "Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the"][[9 14 13] "westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye"][[9 14 14] "not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?"][[9 14 15] "Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with"][[9 14 16] "slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the"][[9 14 17] "shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered,"][[9 14 18] "self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those"][[9 14 19] "days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested"][[9 14 20] "ere he touched a deck. How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a"][[9 14 21] "hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf"][[9 14 22] "with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the"][[9 14 23] "Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on"][[9 14 24] "board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment"][[9 14 25] "desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil eye."][[9 14 26] "Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence;"][[9 14 27] "in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure"][[9 14 28] "the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious"][[9 14 29] "way, one whispers to the other--\"Jack, he's robbed a widow;\" or, \"Joe,"][[9 14 30] "do you mark him; he's a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry lad, I guess he's the"][[9 14 31] "adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing"][[9 14 32] "murderers from Sodom.\" Another runs to read the bill that's stuck"][[9 14 33] "against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering"][[9 14 34] "five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and"][[9 14 35] "containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah"][[9 14 36] "to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,"][[9 14 37] "prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and"][[9 14 38] "summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a"][[9 14 39] "coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong"][[9 14 40] "suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him"][[9 14 41] "not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends"][[9 14 42] "into the cabin."][[9 15 1] "\"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making"][[9 15 2] "out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?' Oh! how that harmless"][[9 15 3] "question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again."][[9 15 4] "But he rallies. 'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon"][[9 15 5] "sail ye, sir?' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,"][[9 15 6] "though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that"][[9 15 7] "hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. 'We sail with the"][[9 15 8] "next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing"][[9 15 9] "him. 'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a"][[9 15 10] "passenger.' Ha! Jonah, that's another stab. But he swiftly calls away"][[9 15 11] "the Captain from that scent. 'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the"][[9 15 12] "passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.' For it is particularly"][[9 15 13] "written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this"][[9 15 14] "history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere the craft did sail. And"][[9 15 15] "taken with the context, this is full of meaning."][[9 16 1] "\"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime"][[9 16 2] "in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this"][[9 16 3] "world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without"][[9 16 4] "a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers."][[9 16 5] "So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's purse, ere he"][[9 16 6] "judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented"][[9 16 7] "to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same"][[9 16 8] "time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when"][[9 16 9] "Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the"][[9 16 10] "Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any"][[9 16 11] "way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. 'Point out my"][[9 16 12] "state-room, Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'"][[9 16 13] "'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain, 'there's thy room.' Jonah"][[9 16 14] "enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing"][[9 16 15] "him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and"][[9 16 16] "mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed"][[9 16 17] "to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws"][[9 16 18] "himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost"][[9 16 19] "resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in"][[9 16 20] "that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah"][[9 16 21] "feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale"][[9 16 22] "shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards."][[9 17 1] "\"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly"][[9 17 2] "oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf"][[9 17 3] "with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all,"][[9 17 4] "though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with"][[9 17 5] "reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it"][[9 17 6] "but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp"][[9 17 7] "alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes"][[9 17 8] "roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no"][[9 17 9] "refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more"][[9 17 10] "and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry."][[9 17 11] "'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it"][[9 17 12] "burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!'"][[9 18 1] "\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still"][[9 18 2] "reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the"][[9 18 3] "Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as"][[9 18 4] "one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,"][[9 18 5] "praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid"][[9 18 6] "the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the"][[9 18 7] "man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught"][[9 18 8] "to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy"][[9 18 9] "of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep."][[9 19 1] "\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and"][[9 19 2] "from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,"][[9 19 3] "glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded"][[9 19 4] "smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not"][[9 19 5] "bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to"][[9 19 6] "break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her;"][[9 19 7] "when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind"][[9 19 8] "is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with"][[9 19 9] "trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah"][[9 19 10] "sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not"][[9 19 11] "the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the"][[9 19 12] "mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after"][[9 19 13] "him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--a"][[9 19 14] "berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the"][[9 19 15] "frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, 'What"][[9 19 16] "meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!' Startled from his lethargy by that"][[9 19 17] "direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck,"][[9 19 18] "grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is"][[9 19 19] "sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after"][[9 19 20] "wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring"][[9 19 21] "fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat."][[9 19 22] "And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep"][[9 19 23] "gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing"][[9 19 24] "bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the"][[9 19 25] "tormented deep."][[9 20 1] "\"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing"][[9 20 2] "attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark"][[9 20 3] "him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,"][[9 20 4] "fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,"][[9 20 5] "they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was"][[9 20 6] "upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they"][[9 20 7] "mob him with their questions. 'What is thine occupation? Whence comest"][[9 20 8] "thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior"][[9 20 9] "of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where"][[9 20 10] "from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions,"][[9 20 11] "but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the"][[9 20 12] "unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is"][[9 20 13] "upon him."][[9 21 1] "\"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven"][[9 21 2] "who hath made the sea and the dry land!' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well"][[9 21 3] "mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN! Straightway, he now goes on to"][[9 21 4] "make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more"][[9 21 5] "appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating"][[9 21 6] "God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his"][[9 21 7] "deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him"][[9 21 8] "forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest"][[9 21 9] "was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to"][[9 21 10] "save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;"][[9 21 11] "then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not"][[9 21 12] "unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah."][[9 22 1] "\"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;"][[9 22 2] "when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea"][[9 22 3] "is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth"][[9 22 4] "water behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless"][[9 22 5] "commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into"][[9 22 6] "the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory"][[9 22 7] "teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto"][[9 22 8] "the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a"][[9 22 9] "weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for"][[9 22 10] "direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He"][[9 22 11] "leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that"][[9 22 12] "spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy"][[9 22 13] "temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not"][[9 22 14] "clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to"][[9 22 15] "God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of"][[9 22 16] "him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before"][[9 22 17] "you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model"][[9 22 18] "for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like"][[9 22 19] "Jonah.\""][[9 23 1] "While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,"][[9 23 2] "slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,"][[9 23 3] "when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself."][[9 23 4] "His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the"][[9 23 5] "warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his"][[9 23 6] "swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple"][[9 23 7] "hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them."][[9 24 1] "There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves"][[9 24 2] "of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed"][[9 24 3] "eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself."][[9 25 1] "But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,"][[9 25 2] "with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these"][[9 25 3] "words:"][[9 26 1] "\"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press"][[9 26 2] "upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that"][[9 26 3] "Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me,"][[9 26 4] "for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down"][[9 26 5] "from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and"][[9 26 6] "listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more"][[9 26 7] "awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God."][[9 26 8] "How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and"][[9 26 9] "bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a"][[9 26 10] "wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled"][[9 26 11] "from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking"][[9 26 12] "ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we"][[9 26 13] "have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to"][[9 26 14] "living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the"][[9 26 15] "midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand"][[9 26 16] "fathoms down, and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the"][[9 26 17] "watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of"][[9 26 18] "any plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon"][[9 26 19] "the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting"][[9 26 20] "prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the"][[9 26 21] "shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching"][[9 26 22] "up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and"][[9 26 23] "earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the"][[9 26 24] "Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears, like"][[9 26 25] "two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean--Jonah"][[9 26 26] "did the Almighty's bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the"][[9 26 27] "Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!"][[9 27 1] "\"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of"][[9 27 2] "the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from"][[9 27 3] "Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God"][[9 27 4] "has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than"][[9 27 5] "to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe"][[9 27 6] "to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour! Woe to him who would"][[9 27 7] "not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him"][[9 27 8] "who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is"][[9 27 9] "himself a castaway!\""][[9 28 1] "He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his"][[9 28 2] "face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with"][[9 28 3] "a heavenly enthusiasm,--\"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of"][[9 28 4] "every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,"][[9 28 5] "than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than"][[9 28 6] "the kelson is low? Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward"][[9 28 7] "delight--who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever"][[9 28 8] "stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong"][[9 28 9] "arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has"][[9 28 10] "gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the"][[9 28 11] "truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out"][[9 28 12] "from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,--top-gallant"][[9 28 13] "delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his"][[9 28 14] "God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the"][[9 28 15] "waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake"][[9 28 16] "from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness"][[9 28 17] "will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final"][[9 28 18] "breath--O Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal,"][[9 28 19] "here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or"][[9 28 20] "mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man"][[9 28 21] "that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\""][[9 29 1] "He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with"][[9 29 2] "his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,"][[9 29 3] "and he was left alone in the place."][[10 0 0] "CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend."][[10 2 1] "Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there"][[10 2 2] "quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time."][[10 2 3] "He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove"][[10 2 4] "hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little"][[10 2 5] "negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife"][[10 2 6] "gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his"][[10 2 7] "heathenish way."][[10 3 1] "But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going"][[10 3 2] "to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap"][[10 3 3] "began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth"][[10 3 4] "page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and"][[10 3 5] "giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He"][[10 3 6] "would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number"][[10 3 7] "one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was"][[10 3 8] "only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his"][[10 3 9] "astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited."][[10 4 1] "With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and"][[10 4 2] "hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his countenance"][[10 4 3] "yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot"][[10 4 4] "hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw"][[10 4 5] "the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,"][[10 4 6] "fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a"][[10 4 7] "thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing"][[10 4 8] "about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim."][[10 4 9] "He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor."][[10 4 10] "Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn"][[10 4 11] "out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it"][[10 4 12] "otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was"][[10 4 13] "his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous,"][[10 4 14] "but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular"][[10 4 15] "busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope"][[10 4 16] "from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two"][[10 4 17] "long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington"][[10 4 18] "cannibalistically developed."][[10 5 1] "Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be"][[10 5 2] "looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,"][[10 5 3] "never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared"][[10 5 4] "wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book."][[10 5 5] "Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night"][[10 5 6] "previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found"][[10 5 7] "thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference"][[10 5 8] "of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not"][[10 5 9] "know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm"][[10 5 10] "self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed"][[10 5 11] "also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the"][[10 5 12] "other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have"][[10 5 13] "no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck"][[10 5 14] "me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something"][[10 5 15] "almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from"][[10 5 16] "home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could"][[10 5 17] "get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in"][[10 5 18] "the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving"][[10 5 19] "the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to"][[10 5 20] "himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he"][[10 5 21] "had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be"][[10 5 22] "true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or"][[10 5 23] "so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself"][[10 5 24] "out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he"][[10 5 25] "must have \"broken his digester.\""][[10 6 1] "As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that"][[10 6 2] "mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then"][[10 6 3] "only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering"][[10 6 4] "round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain;"][[10 6 5] "the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of"][[10 6 6] "strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart"][[10 6 7] "and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing"][[10 6 8] "savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a"][[10 6 9] "nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits."][[10 6 10] "Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself"][[10 6 11] "mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have"][[10 6 12] "repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I'll"][[10 6 13] "try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but"][[10 6 14] "hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs"][[10 6 15] "and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little"][[10 6 16] "noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last"][[10 6 17] "night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be"][[10 6 18] "bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps"][[10 6 19] "a little complimented."][[10 7 1] "We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to"][[10 7 2] "him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures"][[10 7 3] "that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went"][[10 7 4] "to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen"][[10 7 5] "in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing"][[10 7 6] "his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat"][[10 7 7] "exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly"][[10 7 8] "passing between us."][[10 8 1] "If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's"][[10 8 2] "breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left"][[10 8 3] "us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as"][[10 8 4] "I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against"][[10 8 5] "mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were"][[10 8 6] "married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were bosom friends;"][[10 8 7] "he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this"][[10 8 8] "sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing"][[10 8 9] "to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would"][[10 8 10] "not apply."][[10 9 1] "After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room"][[10 9 2] "together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his"][[10 9 3] "enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out"][[10 9 4] "some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and"][[10 9 5] "mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them"][[10 9 6] "towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he"][[10 9 7] "silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them stay."][[10 9 8] "He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed"][[10 9 9] "the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed"][[10 9 10] "anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I"][[10 9 11] "deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or"][[10 9 12] "otherwise."][[10 10 1] "I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible"][[10 10 2] "Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in"][[10 10 3] "worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do"][[10 10 4] "you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and"][[10 10 5] "earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an"][[10 10 6] "insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?--to do"][[10 10 7] "the will of God--THAT is worship. And what is the will of God?--to do to"][[10 10 8] "my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me--THAT is the"][[10 10 9] "will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that"][[10 10 10] "this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular"][[10 10 11] "Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him"][[10 10 12] "in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped"][[10 10 13] "prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with"][[10 10 14] "Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that"][[10 10 15] "done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences"][[10 10 16] "and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat."][[10 11 1] "How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential"][[10 11 2] "disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very"][[10 11 3] "bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie"][[10 11 4] "and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts'"][[10 11 5] "honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving pair."][[11 0 0] "CHAPTER 11. Nightgown."][[11 2 1] "We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and"][[11 2 2] "Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs"][[11 2 3] "over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free"][[11 2 4] "and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what"][[11 2 5] "little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like"][[11 2 6] "getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future."][[11 3 1] "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position"][[11 3 2] "began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves"][[11 3 3] "sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the"][[11 3 4] "head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two"][[11 3 5] "noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt"][[11 3 6] "very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;"][[11 3 7] "indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the"][[11 3 8] "room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some"][[11 3 9] "small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world"][[11 3 10] "that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If"][[11 3 11] "you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so"][[11 3 12] "a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if,"][[11 3 13] "like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown"][[11 3 14] "of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general"][[11 3 15] "consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this"][[11 3 16] "reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which"][[11 3 17] "is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this"][[11 3 18] "sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and"][[11 3 19] "your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the"][[11 3 20] "one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal."][[11 4 1] "We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at"][[11 4 2] "once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether"][[11 4 3] "by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always"][[11 4 4] "keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness"][[11 4 5] "of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright"][[11 4 6] "except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element"][[11 4 7] "of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon"][[11 4 8] "opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created"][[11 4 9] "darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated"][[11 4 10] "twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did"][[11 4 11] "I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to"][[11 4 12] "strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt"][[11 4 13] "a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,"][[11 4 14] "that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the"][[11 4 15] "bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when"][[11 4 16] "love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to"][[11 4 17] "have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full"][[11 4 18] "of such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for"][[11 4 19] "the landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed"][[11 4 20] "confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real"][[11 4 21] "friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed"][[11 4 22] "the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a"][[11 4 23] "blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit"][[11 4 24] "lamp."][[11 5 1] "Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far"][[11 5 2] "distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,"][[11 5 3] "eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly"][[11 5 4] "complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his"][[11 5 5] "words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with"][[11 5 6] "his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as"][[11 5 7] "it may prove in the mere skeleton I give."][[12 0 0] "CHAPTER 12. Biographical."][[12 2 1] "Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and"][[12 2 2] "South. It is not down in any map; true places never are."][[12 3 1] "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in"][[12 3 2] "a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green"][[12 3 3] "sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire"][[12 3 4] "to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His"][[12 3 5] "father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the"][[12 3 6] "maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable"][[12 3 7] "warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins--royal stuff; though"][[12 3 8] "sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his"][[12 3 9] "untutored youth."][[12 4 1] "A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a"][[12 4 2] "passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of"][[12 4 3] "seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's influence"][[12 4 4] "could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled"][[12 4 5] "off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when"][[12 4 6] "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low"][[12 4 7] "tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the"][[12 4 8] "water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its"][[12 4 9] "prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the"][[12 4 10] "ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with"][[12 4 11] "one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up"][[12 4 12] "the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled"][[12 4 13] "a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces."][[12 5 1] "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a"][[12 5 2] "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and"][[12 5 3] "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild"][[12 5 4] "desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told"][[12 5 5] "him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage--this sea"][[12 5 6] "Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put him down among"][[12 5 7] "the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to"][[12 5 8] "toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming"][[12 5 9] "ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his"][[12 5 10] "untutored countrymen. For at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a"][[12 5 11] "profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to"][[12 5 12] "make his people still happier than they were; and more than that,"][[12 5 13] "still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon"][[12 5 14] "convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked;"][[12 5 15] "infinitely more so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last in"][[12 5 16] "old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on"][[12 5 17] "to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,"][[12 5 18] "poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in"][[12 5 19] "all meridians; I'll die a pagan."][[12 6 1] "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,"][[12 6 2] "wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer"][[12 6 3] "ways about him, though now some time from home."][[12 7 1] "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having"][[12 7 2] "a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he"][[12 7 3] "being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet;"][[12 7 4] "and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had"][[12 7 5] "unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan"][[12 7 6] "Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as"][[12 7 7] "he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to"][[12 7 8] "sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a"][[12 7 9] "harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now."][[12 8 1] "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future"][[12 8 2] "movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon"][[12 8 3] "this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my"][[12 8 4] "intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for"][[12 8 5] "an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany"][[12 8 6] "me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,"][[12 8 7] "the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap;"][[12 8 8] "with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds."][[12 8 9] "To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt"][[12 8 10] "for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not"][[12 8 11] "fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant"][[12 8 12] "of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as"][[12 8 13] "known to merchant seamen."][[12 9 1] "His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced"][[12 9 2] "me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we"][[12 9 3] "rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were"][[12 9 4] "sleeping."][[13 0 0] "CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow."][[13 2 1] "Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,"][[13 2 2] "for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using, however, my"][[13 2 3] "comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed"][[13 2 4] "amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between"][[13 2 5] "me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock and bull stories"][[13 2 6] "about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person"][[13 2 7] "whom I now companied with."][[13 3 1] "We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own"][[13 3 2] "poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went"][[13 3 3] "down to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the"][[13 3 4] "wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg"][[13 3 5] "so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their"][[13 3 6] "streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we"][[13 3 7] "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg"][[13 3 8] "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked"][[13 3 9] "him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and"][[13 3 10] "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in"][[13 3 11] "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet"][[13 3 12] "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of"][[13 3 13] "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate"][[13 3 14] "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers"][[13 3 15] "and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows armed with their own"][[13 3 16] "scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--even so, Queequeg,"][[13 3 17] "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon."][[13 4 1] "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about"][[13 4 2] "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners"][[13 4 3] "of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his"][[13 4 4] "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the"][[13 4 5] "thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in"][[13 4 6] "which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it"][[13 4 7] "fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \"Why,\""][[13 4 8] "said I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would"][[13 4 9] "think. Didn't the people laugh?\""][[13 5 1] "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of"][[13 5 2] "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water"][[13 5 3] "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and"][[13 5 4] "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided"][[13 5 5] "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once"][[13 5 6] "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very"][[13 5 7] "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--this"][[13 5 8] "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a"][[13 5 9] "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding"][[13 5 10] "guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain"][[13 5 11] "marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over"][[13 5 12] "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the"][[13 5 13] "King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,--for those people have their"][[13 5 14] "grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such"][[13 5 15] "times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the"][[13 5 16] "ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say,"][[13 5 17] "being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony"][[13 5 18] "of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers"][[13 5 19] "into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself"][[13 5 20] "placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking"][[13 5 21] "himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a"][[13 5 22] "mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain coolly"][[13 5 23] "proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a"][[13 5 24] "huge finger-glass. \"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you tink now?--Didn't our"][[13 5 25] "people laugh?\""][[13 6 1] "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner."][[13 6 2] "Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New"][[13 6 3] "Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all"][[13 6 4] "glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on"][[13 6 5] "casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering"][[13 6 6] "whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others"][[13 6 7] "came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and"][[13 6 8] "forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the"][[13 6 9] "start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a"][[13 6 10] "second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever"][[13 6 11] "and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all"][[13 6 12] "earthly effort."][[13 7 1] "Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little"][[13 7 2] "Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings."][[13 7 3] "How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!--that"][[13 7 4] "common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and"][[13 7 5] "hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will"][[13 7 6] "permit no records."][[13 8 1] "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me."][[13 8 2] "His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth."][[13 8 3] "On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the"][[13 8 4] "blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways"][[13 8 5] "leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the"][[13 8 6] "two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of"][[13 8 7] "this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that"][[13 8 8] "for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a"][[13 8 9] "lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so"][[13 8 10] "companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a"][[13 8 11] "whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,"][[13 8 12] "by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of"][[13 8 13] "all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him"][[13 8 14] "behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping"][[13 8 15] "his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost"][[13 8 16] "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;"][[13 8 17] "then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with"][[13 8 18] "bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,"][[13 8 19] "lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff."][[13 9 1] "\"Capting! Capting!\" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;"][[13 9 2] "\"Capting, Capting, here's the devil.\""][[13 10 1] "\"Hallo, _you_ sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking"][[13 10 2] "up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you"][[13 10 3] "might have killed that chap?\""][[13 11 1] "\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me."][[13 12 1] "\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\" pointing"][[13 12 2] "to the still shivering greenhorn."][[13 13 1] "\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly"][[13 13 2] "expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e"][[13 13 3] "so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\""][[13 14 1] "\"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you"][[13 14 2] "try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\""][[13 15 1] "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to"][[13 15 2] "mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted"][[13 15 3] "the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to"][[13 15 4] "side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor"][[13 15 5] "fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all"][[13 15 6] "hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,"][[13 15 7] "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost"][[13 15 8] "in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of"][[13 15 9] "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of"][[13 15 10] "being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the"][[13 15 11] "boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the"][[13 15 12] "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and"][[13 15 13] "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one"][[13 15 14] "end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it"][[13 15 15] "round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar"][[13 15 16] "was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the"][[13 15 17] "wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,"][[13 15 18] "stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of"][[13 15 19] "a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,"][[13 15 20] "throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing"][[13 15 21] "his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand"][[13 15 22] "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone"][[13 15 23] "down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now"][[13 15 24] "took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters"][[13 15 25] "were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,"][[13 15 26] "one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form."][[13 15 27] "The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands"][[13 15 28] "voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that"][[13 15 29] "hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took"][[13 15 30] "his last long dive."][[13 16 1] "Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at"][[13 16 2] "all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only"][[13 16 3] "asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that"][[13 16 4] "done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the"][[13 16 5] "bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying"][[13 16 6] "to himself--\"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians.

Nantucket."][[14 2 1] "Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a"][[14 2 2] "fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket."][[14 3 1] "Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of"][[14 3 2] "the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely"][[14 3 3] "than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it--a mere hillock, and elbow of"][[14 3 4] "sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than"][[14 3 5] "you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some"][[14 3 6] "gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they"][[14 3 7] "don't grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have"][[14 3 8] "to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that"][[14 3 9] "pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true"][[14 3 10] "cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,"][[14 3 11] "to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an"][[14 3 12] "oasis, three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand"][[14 3 13] "shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,"][[14 3 14] "belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island"][[14 3 15] "of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will"][[14 3 16] "sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these"][[14 3 17] "extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois."][[14 4 1] "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was"][[14 4 2] "settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle"][[14 4 3] "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant"][[14 4 4] "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne"][[14 4 5] "out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same"][[14 4 6] "direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they"][[14 4 7] "discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--the"][[14 4 8] "poor little Indian's skeleton."][[14 5 1] "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take"][[14 5 2] "to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in"][[14 5 3] "the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more"][[14 5 4] "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,"][[14 5 5] "launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;"][[14 5 6] "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in"][[14 5 7] "at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared"][[14 5 8] "everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the"][[14 5 9] "flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea"][[14 5 10] "Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that"][[14 5 11] "his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and"][[14 5 12] "malicious assaults!"][[14 6 1] "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from"][[14 6 2] "their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like"][[14 6 3] "so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and"][[14 6 4] "Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add"][[14 6 5] "Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm"][[14 6 6] "all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds"][[14 6 7] "of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he"][[14 6 8] "owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of"][[14 6 9] "way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but"][[14 6 10] "floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea"][[14 6 11] "as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of"][[14 6 12] "the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the"][[14 6 13] "bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on"][[14 6 14] "the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and"][[14 6 15] "fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. THERE is his home; THERE"][[14 6 16] "lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it"][[14 6 17] "overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie"][[14 6 18] "cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as"][[14 6 19] "chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so"][[14 6 20] "that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more"][[14 6 21] "strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull,"][[14 6 22] "that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows;"][[14 6 23] "so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails,"][[14 6 24] "and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of"][[14 6 25] "walruses and whales."][[15 0 0] "CHAPTER 15. Chowder."][[15 2 1] "It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly"][[15 2 2] "to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no"][[15 2 3] "business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of"][[15 2 4] "the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the"][[15 2 5] "Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept"][[15 2 6] "hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin"][[15 2 7] "Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he"][[15 2 8] "plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at"][[15 2 9] "the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow"][[15 2 10] "warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the"][[15 2 11] "larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a"][[15 2 12] "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first"][[15 2 13] "man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very"][[15 2 14] "much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg"][[15 2 15] "insisted that the yellow warehouse--our first point of departure--must"][[15 2 16] "be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to"][[15 2 17] "say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little"][[15 2 18] "in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant"][[15 2 19] "to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no"][[15 2 20] "mistaking."][[15 3 1] "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,"][[15 3 2] "swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an"][[15 3 3] "old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other"][[15 3 4] "side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows."][[15 3 5] "Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I"][[15 3 6] "could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of"][[15 3 7] "crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, TWO"][[15 3 8] "of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A"][[15 3 9] "Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones"][[15 3 10] "staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair"][[15 3 11] "of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints"][[15 3 12] "touching Tophet?"][[15 4 1] "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman"][[15 4 2] "with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,"][[15 4 3] "under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured"][[15 4 4] "eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen"][[15 4 5] "shirt."][[15 5 1] "\"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I'll be combing ye!\""][[15 6 1] "\"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right. There's Mrs. Hussey.\""][[15 7 1] "And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving"][[15 7 2] "Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon"][[15 7 3] "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing"][[15 7 4] "further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and"][[15 7 5] "seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded"][[15 7 6] "repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\""][[15 8 1] "\"What's that about Cods, ma'am?\" said I, with much politeness."][[15 9 1] "\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated."][[15 10 1] "\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\""][[15 10 2] "says I, \"but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter"][[15 10 3] "time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?\""][[15 11 1] "But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple"][[15 11 2] "Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing"][[15 11 3] "but the word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to"][[15 11 4] "the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared."][[15 12 1] "\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us"][[15 12 2] "both on one clam?\""][[15 13 1] "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the"][[15 13 2] "apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder"][[15 13 3] "came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!"][[15 13 4] "hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than"][[15 13 5] "hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into"][[15 13 6] "little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned"][[15 13 7] "with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty"][[15 13 8] "voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food"][[15 13 9] "before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched"][[15 13 10] "it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking"][[15 13 11] "me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try"][[15 13 12] "a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word"][[15 13 13] "\"cod\" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the"][[15 13 14] "savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good"][[15 13 15] "time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us."][[15 14 1] "We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I"][[15 14 2] "to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?"][[15 14 3] "What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \"But look,"][[15 14 4] "Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?\""][[15 15 1] "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved"][[15 15 2] "its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for"][[15 15 3] "breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you"][[15 15 4] "began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area"][[15 15 5] "before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished"][[15 15 6] "necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books"][[15 15 7] "bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,"][[15 15 8] "too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening"][[15 15 9] "to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw"][[15 15 10] "Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the"][[15 15 11] "sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slip-shod,"][[15 15 12] "I assure ye."][[15 16 1] "Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey"][[15 16 2] "concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede"][[15 16 3] "me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his"][[15 16 4] "harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \"Why not?\" said I;"][[15 16 5] "\"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?\" \"Because"][[15 16 6] "it's dangerous,\" says she. \"Ever since young Stiggs coming from that"][[15 16 7] "unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with"][[15 16 8] "only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back, with"][[15 16 9] "his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take"][[15 16 10] "sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg\" (for"][[15 16 11] "she had learned his name), \"I will just take this here iron, and keep"][[15 16 12] "it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for"][[15 16 13] "breakfast, men?\""][[15 17 1] "\"Both,\" says I; \"and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of"][[15 17 2] "variety.\""][[16 0 0] "CHAPTER 16. The Ship."][[16 2 1] "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and"][[16 2 2] "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been"][[16 2 3] "diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo"][[16 2 4] "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it"][[16 2 5] "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in"][[16 2 6] "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo"][[16 2 7] "earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly"][[16 2 8] "with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to"][[16 2 9] "do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,"][[16 2 10] "Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it"][[16 2 11] "had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship"][[16 2 12] "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg."][[16 3 1] "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great"][[16 3 2] "confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast"][[16 3 3] "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good"][[16 3 4] "sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all"][[16 3 5] "cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs."][[16 4 1] "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection"][[16 4 2] "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied"][[16 4 3] "upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry"][[16 4 4] "us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced"][[16 4 5] "no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly"][[16 4 6] "prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort"][[16 4 7] "of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little"][[16 4 8] "affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our"][[16 4 9] "little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,"][[16 4 10] "or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that"][[16 4 11] "day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself"][[16 4 12] "to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX"][[16 4 13] "Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo"][[16 4 14] "warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among"][[16 4 15] "the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries,"][[16 4 16] "I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The"][[16 4 17] "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the"][[16 4 18] "origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was"][[16 4 19] "the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct"][[16 4 20] "as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,"][[16 4 21] "hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,"][[16 4 22] "looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very"][[16 4 23] "ship for us."][[16 5 1] "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I"][[16 5 2] "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box"][[16 5 3] "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a"][[16 5 4] "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old"][[16 5 5] "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look"][[16 5 6] "about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms"][[16 5 7] "of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French"][[16 5 8] "grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable"][[16 5 9] "bows looked bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,"][[16 5 10] "where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood"][[16 5 11] "stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her"][[16 5 12] "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped"][[16 5 13] "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these"][[16 5 14] "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining"][[16 5 15] "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed."][[16 5 16] "Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded"][[16 5 17] "another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the"][[16 5 18] "principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his"][[16 5 19] "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid"][[16 5 20] "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched"][[16 5 21] "by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She"][[16 5 22] "was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with"][[16 5 23] "pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of"][[16 5 24] "a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All"][[16 5 25] "round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous"][[16 5 26] "jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for"][[16 5 27] "pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not"][[16 5 28] "through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of"][[16 5 29] "sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported"][[16 5 30] "there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved"][[16 5 31] "from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who"][[16 5 32] "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds"][[16 5 33] "back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a"][[16 5 34] "most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that."][[16 6 1] "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,"][[16 6 2] "in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw"][[16 6 3] "nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or"][[16 6 4] "rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only"][[16 6 5] "a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten"][[16 6 6] "feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken"][[16 6 7] "from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale."][[16 6 8] "Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced"][[16 6 9] "together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in"][[16 6 10] "a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the"][[16 6 11] "top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening"][[16 6 12] "faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a"][[16 6 13] "complete view forward."][[16 7 1] "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who"][[16 7 2] "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and"][[16 7 3] "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of"][[16 7 4] "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all"][[16 7 5] "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a"][[16 7 6] "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was"][[16 7 7] "constructed."][[16 8 1] "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of"][[16 8 2] "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,"][[16 8 3] "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;"][[16 8 4] "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest"][[16 8 5] "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from"][[16 8 6] "his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to"][[16 8 7] "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed"][[16 8 8] "together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl."][[16 9 1] "\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of"][[16 9 2] "the tent."][[16 10 1] "\"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?\""][[16 10 2] "he demanded."][[16 11 1] "\"I was thinking of shipping.\""][[16 12 1] "\"Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in a"][[16 12 2] "stove boat?\""][[16 13 1] "\"No, Sir, I never have.\""][[16 14 1] "\"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?"][[16 15 1] "\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been several"][[16 15 2] "voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--\""][[16 16 1] "\"Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that"][[16 16 2] "leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of"][[16 16 3] "the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now"][[16 16 4] "ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships."][[16 16 5] "But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks"][[16 16 6] "a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast"][[16 16 7] "thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think of"][[16 16 8] "murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\""][[16 17 1] "I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask"][[16 17 2] "of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated"][[16 17 3] "Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather"][[16 17 4] "distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the"][[16 17 5] "Vineyard."][[16 18 1] "\"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of"][[16 18 2] "shipping ye.\""][[16 19 1] "\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\""][[16 20 1] "\"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\""][[16 21 1] "\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\""][[16 22 1] "\"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\""][[16 23 1] "\"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\""][[16 24 1] "\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,"][[16 24 2] "young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted"][[16 24 3] "out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We"][[16 24 4] "are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest"][[16 24 5] "to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of"][[16 24 6] "finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap"][[16 24 7] "eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one"][[16 24 8] "leg.\""][[16 25 1] "\"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?\""][[16 26 1] "\"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,"][[16 26 2] "chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a"][[16 26 3] "boat!--ah, ah!\""][[16 27 1] "I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at"][[16 27 2] "the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I"][[16 27 3] "could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know"][[16 27 4] "there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed"][[16 27 5] "I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.\""][[16 28 1] "\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou"][[16 28 2] "dost not talk shark a bit. SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure of"][[16 28 3] "that?\""][[16 29 1] "\"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the"][[16 29 2] "merchant--\""][[16 30 1] "\"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant"][[16 30 2] "service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it. But let us understand each"][[16 30 3] "other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel"][[16 30 4] "inclined for it?\""][[16 31 1] "\"I do, sir.\""][[16 32 1] "\"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's"][[16 32 2] "throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\""][[16 33 1] "\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be"][[16 33 2] "got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact.\""][[16 34 1] "\"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find"][[16 34 2] "out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to"][[16 34 3] "see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just"][[16 34 4] "step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back"][[16 34 5] "to me and tell me what ye see there.\""][[16 35 1] "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not"][[16 35 2] "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But"][[16 35 3] "concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started"][[16 35 4] "me on the errand."][[16 36 1] "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the"][[16 36 2] "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely"][[16 36 3] "pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but"][[16 36 4] "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I"][[16 36 5] "could see."][[16 37 1] "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye"][[16 37 2] "see?\""][[16 38 1] "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,"][[16 38 2] "and there's a squall coming up, I think.\""][[16 39 1] "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go"][[16 39 2] "round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where"][[16 39 3] "you stand?\""][[16 40 1] "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the"][[16 40 2] "Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now"][[16 40 3] "repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness"][[16 40 4] "to ship me."][[16 41 1] "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come"][[16 41 2] "along with ye.\" And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin."][[16 42 1] "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and"][[16 42 2] "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with"][[16 42 3] "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other"][[16 42 4] "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd"][[16 42 5] "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each"][[16 42 6] "owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail"][[16 42 7] "or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling"][[16 42 8] "vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks"][[16 42 9] "bringing in good interest."][[16 43 1] "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a"][[16 43 2] "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to"][[16 43 3] "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the"][[16 43 4] "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified"][[16 43 5] "by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same"][[16 43 6] "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They"][[16 43 7] "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance."][[16 44 1] "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture"][[16 44 2] "names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood"][[16 44 3] "naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker"][[16 44 4] "idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure"][[16 44 5] "of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown"][[16 44 6] "peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a"][[16 44 7] "Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things"][[16 44 8] "unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain"][[16 44 9] "and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion"][[16 44 10] "of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath"][[16 44 11] "constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think"][[16 44 12] "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or"][[16 44 13] "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding"][[16 44 14] "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental"][[16 44 15] "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes"][[16 44 16] "one in a whole nation's census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for"][[16 44 17] "noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically"][[16 44 18] "regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems"][[16 44 19] "a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all"][[16 44 20] "men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure"][[16 44 21] "of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,"][[16 44 22] "as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and"][[16 44 23] "still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another"][[16 44 24] "phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances."][[16 45 1] "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman."][[16 45 2] "But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called"][[16 45 3] "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the"][[16 45 4] "veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally"][[16 45 5] "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all"][[16 45 6] "his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island"][[16 45 7] "creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born"][[16 45 8] "Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his"][[16 45 9] "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of"][[16 45 10] "common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from"][[16 45 11] "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself"][[16 45 12] "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe"][[16 45 13] "to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns"][[16 45 14] "upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his"][[16 45 15] "days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do"][[16 45 16] "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably"][[16 45 17] "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's"][[16 45 18] "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This"][[16 45 19] "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes"][[16 45 20] "of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;"][[16 45 21] "from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a"][[16 45 22] "ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous"][[16 45 23] "career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of"][[16 45 24] "sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his"][[16 45 25] "well-earned income."][[16 46 1] "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an"][[16 46 2] "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard"][[16 46 3] "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a"][[16 46 4] "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,"][[16 46 5] "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore"][[16 46 6] "exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was"][[16 46 7] "certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,"][[16 46 8] "though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate"][[16 46 9] "quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a"][[16 46 10] "chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made"][[16 46 11] "you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer"][[16 46 12] "or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,"][[16 46 13] "never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own"][[16 46 14] "person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his"][[16 46 15] "long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,"][[16 46 16] "his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his"][[16 46 17] "broad-brimmed hat."][[16 47 1] "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I"][[16 47 2] "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks"][[16 47 3] "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,"][[16 47 4] "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was"][[16 47 5] "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was"][[16 47 6] "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in"][[16 47 7] "reading from a ponderous volume."][[16 48 1] "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been"][[16 48 2] "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain"][[16 48 3] "knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\""][[16 49 1] "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,"][[16 49 2] "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and"][[16 49 3] "seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg."][[16 50 1] "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\""][[16 51 1] "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me."][[16 52 1] "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker."][[16 53 1] "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg."][[16 54 1] "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at"][[16 54 2] "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible."][[16 55 1] "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,"][[16 55 2] "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said"][[16 55 3] "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,"][[16 55 4] "and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,"][[16 55 5] "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time"][[16 55 6] "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the"][[16 55 7] "voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no"][[16 55 8] "wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of"][[16 55 9] "the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the"][[16 55 10] "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's"][[16 55 11] "company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own"][[16 55 12] "lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,"][[16 55 13] "could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that"][[16 55 14] "from all I had heard I should be offered at least the th lay--that"][[16 55 15] "is, the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever"][[16 55 16] "that might eventually amount to. And though the th lay was what they"][[16 55 17] "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a"][[16 55 18] "lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out"][[16 55 19] "on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would"][[16 55 20] "not have to pay one stiver."][[16 56 1] "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely"][[16 56 2] "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those"][[16 56 3] "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the"][[16 56 4] "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim"][[16 56 5] "sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the th lay"][[16 56 6] "would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I"][[16 56 7] "been offered the th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make."][[16 57 1] "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about"][[16 57 2] "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard"][[16 57 3] "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;"][[16 57 4] "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore"][[16 57 5] "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the"][[16 57 6] "whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know"][[16 57 7] "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about"][[16 57 8] "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,"][[16 57 9] "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his"][[16 57 10] "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his"][[16 57 11] "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was"][[16 57 12] "such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded"][[16 57 13] "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"LAY not up for"][[16 57 14] "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--\""][[16 58 1] "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay"][[16 58 2] "shall we give this young man?\""][[16 59 1] "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and"][[16 59 2] "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do"][[16 59 3] "corrupt, but LAY--'\""][[16 60 1] "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and"][[16 60 2] "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,"][[16 60 3] "shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt."][[16 60 4] "It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the"][[16 60 5] "magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet"][[16 60 6] "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and"][[16 60 7] "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make"][[16 60 8] "a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and"][[16 60 9] "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven"][[16 60 10] "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time."][[16 61 1] "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to"][[16 61 2] "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\""][[16 62 1] "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without lifting"][[16 62 2] "his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure is, there"][[16 62 3] "will your heart be also.\""][[16 63 1] "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye"][[16 63 2] "hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\""][[16 64 1] "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,"][[16 64 2] "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the"][[16 64 3] "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,"][[16 64 4] "many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this"][[16 64 5] "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those"][[16 64 6] "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\""][[16 65 1] "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the"][[16 65 2] "cabin. \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these"][[16 65 3] "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be"][[16 65 4] "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape"][[16 65 5] "Horn.\""][[16 66 1] "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing"][[16 66 2] "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still"][[16 66 3] "an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be"][[16 66 4] "but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the"][[16 66 5] "fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\""][[16 67 1] "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye"][[16 67 2] "insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that"][[16 67 3] "he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and"][[16 67 4] "start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with"][[16 67 5] "all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured"][[16 67 6] "son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\""][[16 68 1] "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous"][[16 68 2] "oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him."][[16 69 1] "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and"][[16 69 2] "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up"][[16 69 3] "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily"][[16 69 4] "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,"][[16 69 5] "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened"][[16 69 6] "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the"][[16 69 7] "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of"][[16 69 8] "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As"][[16 69 9] "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more"][[16 69 10] "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a"][[16 69 11] "little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he whistled at last--\"the"][[16 69 12] "squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at"][[16 69 13] "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs"][[16 69 14] "the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,"][[16 69 15] "Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,"][[16 69 16] "for the three hundredth lay.\""][[16 70 1] "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship"][[16 70 2] "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\""][[16 71 1] "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\""][[16 72 1] "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in"][[16 72 2] "which he had again been burying himself."][[16 73 1] "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever"][[16 73 2] "whaled it any?\" turning to me."][[16 74 1] "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\""][[16 75 1] "\"Well, bring him along then.\""][[16 76 1] "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I"][[16 76 2] "had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical"][[16 76 3] "ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape."][[16 77 1] "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain"][[16 77 2] "with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in"][[16 77 3] "many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all"][[16 77 4] "her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving"][[16 77 5] "to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the"][[16 77 6] "shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have"][[16 77 7] "a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble"][[16 77 8] "himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till"][[16 77 9] "all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at"][[16 77 10] "him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back"][[16 77 11] "I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found."][[16 78 1] "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou"][[16 78 2] "art shipped.\""][[16 79 1] "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\""][[16 80 1] "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly"][[16 80 2] "what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort"][[16 80 3] "of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he"][[16 80 4] "isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I"][[16 80 5] "don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some"][[16 80 6] "think--but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no"][[16 80 7] "fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak"][[16 80 8] "much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be"][[16 80 9] "forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as"][[16 80 10] "'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed"][[16 80 11] "his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance!"][[16 80 12] "aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't"][[16 80 13] "Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab"][[16 80 14] "of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!\""][[16 81 1] "\"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did"][[16 81 2] "they not lick his blood?\""][[16 82 1] "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance in"][[16 82 2] "his eye that almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never say that on board"][[16 82 3] "the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself."][[16 82 4] "'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died"][[16 82 5] "when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at"][[16 82 6] "Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps,"][[16 82 7] "other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a"][[16 82 8] "lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago;"][[16 82 9] "I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but"][[16 82 10] "a swearing good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of"][[16 82 11] "him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on"][[16 82 12] "the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it"][[16 82 13] "was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that"][[16 82 14] "about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost"][[16 82 15] "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of"][[16 82 16] "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass"][[16 82 17] "off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's"][[16 82 18] "better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So"][[16 82 19] "good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to"][[16 82 20] "have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages"][[16 82 21] "wedded--a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that"][[16 82 22] "old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless"][[16 82 23] "harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his"][[16 82 24] "humanities!\""][[16 83 1] "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been"][[16 83 2] "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain"][[16 83 3] "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,"][[16 83 4] "I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what,"][[16 83 5] "unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange"][[16 83 6] "awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was"][[16 83 7] "not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did"][[16 83 8] "not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed"][[16 83 9] "like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However,"][[16 83 10] "my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the"][[16 83 11] "present dark Ahab slipped my mind."][[17 0 0] "CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan."][[17 2 1] "As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all"][[17 2 2] "day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I"][[17 2 3] "cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations,"][[17 2 4] "never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue"][[17 2 5] "even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other"][[17 2 6] "creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism"][[17 2 7] "quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of"][[17 2 8] "a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate"][[17 2 9] "possessions yet owned and rented in his name."][[17 3 1] "I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these"][[17 3 2] "things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,"][[17 3 3] "pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these"][[17 3 4] "subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most"][[17 3 5] "absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that? Queequeg"][[17 3 6] "thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;"][[17 3 7] "and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let"][[17 3 8] "him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans"][[17 3 9] "alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and"][[17 3 10] "sadly need mending."][[17 4 1] "Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and"][[17 4 2] "rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but"][[17 4 3] "no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. \"Queequeg,\""][[17 4 4] "said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent. \"I say, Queequeg! why"][[17 4 5] "don't you speak? It's I--Ishmael.\" But all remained still as before. I"][[17 4 6] "began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought"][[17 4 7] "he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but"][[17 4 8] "the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect"][[17 4 9] "was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the"][[17 4 10] "foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I"][[17 4 11] "was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of"][[17 4 12] "Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken"][[17 4 13] "from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That's strange, thought I;"][[17 4 14] "but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or"][[17 4 15] "never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no"][[17 4 16] "possible mistake."][[17 5 1] "\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still. Something must have happened."][[17 5 2] "Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted."][[17 5 3] "Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person"][[17 5 4] "I met--the chamber-maid. \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I thought something must"][[17 5 5] "be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was"][[17 5 6] "locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever"][[17 5 7] "since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your"][[17 5 8] "baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma'am!--Mistress! murder! Mrs."][[17 5 9] "Hussey! apoplexy!\"--and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I"][[17 5 10] "following."][[17 6 1] "Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a"][[17 6 2] "vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation"][[17 6 3] "of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime."][[17 7 1] "\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it? Run for God's sake, and fetch"][[17 7 2] "something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a stroke;"][[17 7 3] "depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs"][[17 7 4] "again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and"][[17 7 5] "vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance."][[17 8 1] "\"What's the matter with you, young man?\""][[17 9 1] "\"Get the axe!

What's the matter with you, shipmate?\""][[17 11 1] "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the"][[17 11 2] "whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her"][[17 11 3] "nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No! I haven't seen"][[17 11 4] "it since I put it there.\" Running to a little closet under the landing"][[17 11 5] "of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's"][[17 11 6] "harpoon was missing. \"He's killed himself,\" she cried. \"It's unfort'nate"][[17 11 7] "Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane--God pity his poor"][[17 11 8] "mother!--it will be the ruin of my house.

For some time, do all I would, I could not get into"][[17 24 6] "the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought"][[17 24 7] "of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,"][[17 24 8] "stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of"][[17 24 9] "it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his"][[17 24 10] "hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!"][[17 25 1] "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of"][[17 25 2] "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he"][[17 25 3] "had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of"][[17 25 4] "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,"][[17 25 5] "but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his"][[17 25 6] "forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over."][[17 26 1] "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion,"][[17 26 2] "be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any"][[17 26 3] "other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when"][[17 26 4] "a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment"][[17 26 5] "to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to"][[17 26 6] "lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and"][[17 26 7] "argue the point with him."][[17 27 1] "And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into bed"][[17 27 2] "now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the rise"][[17 27 3] "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various"][[17 27 4] "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show"][[17 27 5] "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in"][[17 27 6] "cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless"][[17 27 7] "for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and"][[17 27 8] "common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an"][[17 27 9] "extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained"][[17 27 10] "me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan"][[17 27 11] "of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the"][[17 27 12] "spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be"][[17 27 13] "half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish"][[17 27 14] "such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg,"][[17 27 15] "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested"][[17 27 16] "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary"][[17 27 17] "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans."][[17 28 1] "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with"][[17 28 2] "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it"][[17 28 3] "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great"][[17 28 4] "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle"][[17 28 5] "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the"][[17 28 6] "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening."][[17 29 1] "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the"][[17 29 2] "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had"][[17 29 3] "visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when"][[17 29 4] "a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the"][[17 29 5] "yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed"][[17 29 6] "in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with"][[17 29 7] "breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were"][[17 29 8] "sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as"][[17 29 9] "though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys."][[17 30 1] "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much"][[17 30 2] "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed"][[17 30 3] "dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his"][[17 30 4] "own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one"][[17 30 5] "third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he"][[17 30 6] "no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than"][[17 30 7] "I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and"][[17 30 8] "compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible"][[17 30 9] "young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety."][[17 31 1] "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty"][[17 31 2] "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not"][[17 31 3] "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the"][[17 31 4] "Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones."][[18 0 0] "CHAPTER 18.

But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of"][[19 25 4] "that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about"][[19 25 5] "the loss of his leg.\""][[19 26 1] "\"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?\""][[19 27 1] "\"Pretty sure.\""][[19 28 1] "With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like"][[19 28 2] "stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a"][[19 28 3] "little, turned and said:--\"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the"][[19 28 4] "papers? Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be;"][[19 28 5] "and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. Anyhow, it's all fixed"][[19 28 6] "and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I"][[19 28 7] "suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!

But we had not gone"][[19 35 4] "perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and"][[19 35 5] "looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,"][[19 35 6] "though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I"][[19 35 7] "said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my"][[19 35 8] "comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner"][[19 35 9] "that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging"][[19 35 10] "us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This"][[19 35 11] "circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,"][[19 35 12] "shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments"][[19 35 13] "and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain"][[19 35 14] "Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver"][[19 35 15] "calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship"][[19 35 16] "the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage"][[19 35 17] "we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things."][[19 36 1] "I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really"][[19 36 2] "dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,"][[19 36 3] "and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without"][[19 36 4] "seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it"][[19 36 5] "seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug."][[20 0 0] "CHAPTER 20. All Astir."][[20 2 1] "A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod."][[20 2 2] "Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on"][[20 2 3] "board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything"][[20 2 4] "betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain"][[20 2 5] "Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp"][[20 2 6] "look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing"][[20 2 7] "at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were"][[20 2 8] "working till long after night-fall."][[20 3 1] "On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at"][[20 3 2] "all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their chests"][[20 3 3] "must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon"][[20 3 4] "the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,"][[20 3 5] "resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they"][[20 3 6] "always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail"][[20 3 7] "for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and"][[20 3 8] "there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod"][[20 3 9] "was fully equipped."][[20 4 1] "Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives"][[20 4 2] "and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are"][[20 4 3] "indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,"][[20 4 4] "which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,"][[20 4 5] "far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And"][[20 4 6] "though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means"][[20 4 7] "to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the"][[20 4 8] "whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the"][[20 4 9] "fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors"][[20 4 10] "usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling"][[20 4 11] "vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially"][[20 4 12] "to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of"][[20 4 13] "the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare"][[20 4 14] "lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain"][[20 4 15] "and duplicate ship."][[20 5 1] "At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the"][[20 5 2] "Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,"][[20 5 3] "fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time"][[20 5 4] "there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and"][[20 5 5] "ends of things, both large and small."][[20 6 1] "Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain"][[20 6 2] "Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable"][[20 6 3] "spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if SHE"][[20 6 4] "could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once"][[20 6 5] "fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar"][[20 6 6] "of pickles for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of quills"][[20 6 7] "for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a"][[20 6 8] "roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. Never did"][[20 6 9] "any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as"][[20 6 10] "everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable"][[20 6 11] "Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand"][[20 6 12] "and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and"][[20 6 13] "consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother"][[20 6 14] "Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of"][[20 6 15] "well-saved dollars."][[20 7 1] "But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on"][[20 7 2] "board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and"][[20 7 3] "a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor"][[20 7 4] "Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him"][[20 7 5] "a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down"][[20 7 6] "went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a"][[20 7 7] "while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men"][[20 7 8] "down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then"][[20 7 9] "concluded by roaring back into his wigwam."][[20 8 1] "During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the"][[20 8 2] "craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when"][[20 8 3] "he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would"][[20 8 4] "answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard"][[20 8 5] "every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend"][[20 8 6] "to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been"][[20 8 7] "downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart"][[20 8 8] "that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,"][[20 8 9] "without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute"][[20 8 10] "dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea."][[20 8 11] "But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be"][[20 8 12] "already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his"][[20 8 13] "suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said"][[20 8 14] "nothing, and tried to think nothing."][[20 9 1] "At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would"][[20 9 2] "certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start."][[21 0 0] "CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard."][[21 2 1] "It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we"][[21 2 2] "drew nigh the wharf."][[21 3 1] "\"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\" said I to"][[21 3 2] "Queequeg, \"it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\""][[21 4 1] "\"Avast!\" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind"][[21 4 2] "us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself"][[21 4 3] "between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,"][[21 4 4] "strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah."][[21 5 1] "\"Going aboard?\""][[21 6 1] "\"Hands off, will you,\" said I."][[21 7 1] "\"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself, \"go 'way!\""][[21 8 1] "\"Ain't going aboard, then?\""][[21 9 1] "\"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but what business is that of yours? Do you know,"][[21 9 2] "Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\""][[21 10 1] "\"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that,\" said Elijah, slowly and"][[21 10 2] "wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable"][[21 10 3] "glances."][[21 11 1] "\"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We"][[21 11 2] "are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be"][[21 11 3] "detained.\""][[21 12 1] "\"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?\""][[21 13 1] "\"He's cracked, Queequeg,\" said I, \"come on.\""][[21 14 1] "\"Holloa!\" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few"][[21 14 2] "paces."][[21 15 1] "\"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come on.\""][[21 16 1] "But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my"][[21 16 2] "shoulder, said--\"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that"][[21 16 3] "ship a while ago?\""][[21 17 1] "Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \"Yes,"][[21 17 2] "I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.\""][[21 18 1] "\"Very dim, very dim,\" said Elijah. \"Morning to ye.\""][[21 19 1] "Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and"][[21 19 2] "touching my shoulder again, said, \"See if you can find 'em now, will ye?"][[21 20 1] "\"Find who?\""][[21 21 1] "\"Morning to ye! morning to ye!\" he rejoined, again moving off. \"Oh! I"][[21 21 2] "was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all one,"][[21 21 3] "all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? Good-bye to"][[21 21 4] "ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand"][[21 21 5] "Jury.\" And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for"][[21 21 6] "the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence."][[21 22 1] "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound"][[21 22 2] "quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the"][[21 22 3] "hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward"][[21 22 4] "to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a"][[21 22 5] "light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a"][[21 22 6] "tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his"][[21 22 7] "face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber"][[21 22 8] "slept upon him."][[21 23 1] "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said I,"][[21 23 2] "looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,"][[21 23 3] "Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would"][[21 23 4] "have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,"][[21 23 5] "were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the"][[21 23 6] "thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg"][[21 23 7] "that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish"][[21 23 8] "himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though"][[21 23 9] "feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly"][[21 23 10] "down there."][[21 24 1] "\"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I."][[21 25 1] "\"Oh! perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg, \"my country way; won't hurt him"][[21 25 2] "face.\""][[21 26 1] "\"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;"][[21 26 2] "but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you"][[21 26 3] "are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,"][[21 26 4] "he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake.\""][[21 27 1] "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and"][[21 27 2] "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing"][[21 27 3] "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him"][[21 27 4] "in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his"][[21 27 5] "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,"][[21 27 6] "chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some"][[21 27 7] "of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in"][[21 27 8] "that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay"][[21 27 9] "them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on"][[21 27 10] "an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible"][[21 27 11] "into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and"][[21 27 12] "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps"][[21 27 13] "in some damp marshy place."][[21 28 1] "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk"][[21 28 2] "from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head."][[21 29 1] "\"What's that for, Queequeg?\""][[21 30 1] "\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\""][[21 31 1] "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,"][[21 31 2] "which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed"][[21 31 3] "his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The"][[21 31 4] "strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began"][[21 31 5] "to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed"][[21 31 6] "troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and"][[21 31 7] "rubbed his eyes."][[21 32 1] "\"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\""][[21 33 1] "\"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\""][[21 34 1] "\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain"][[21 34 2] "came aboard last night.\""][[21 35 1] "\"What Captain?--Ahab?\""][[21 36 1] "\"Who but him indeed?\""][[21 37 1] "I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we"][[21 37 2] "heard a noise on deck."][[21 38 1] "\"Holloa! Starbuck's astir,\" said the rigger. \"He's a lively chief mate,"][[21 38 2] "that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\" And so"][[21 38 3] "saying he went on deck, and we followed."][[21 39 1] "It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and"][[21 39 2] "threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively"][[21 39 3] "engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various"][[21 39 4] "last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly"][[21 39 5] "enshrined within his cabin."][[22 0 0] "CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas."][[22 2 1] "At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers,"][[22 2 2] "and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the"][[22 2 3] "ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last"][[22 2 4] "gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a"][[22 2 5] "spare Bible for the steward--after all this, the two Captains, Peleg"][[22 2 6] "and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg"][[22 2 7] "said:"][[22 3 1] "\"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is"][[22 3 2] "all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore, eh?"][[22 3 3] "Well, call all hands, then. Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!\""][[22 4 1] "\"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\" said Bildad,"][[22 4 2] "\"but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\""][[22 5 1] "How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain"][[22 5 2] "Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the"][[22 5 3] "quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as"][[22 5 4] "well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of"][[22 5 5] "him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,"][[22 5 6] "the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the"][[22 5 7] "ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was"][[22 5 8] "not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not"][[22 5 9] "yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed"][[22 5 10] "below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant"][[22 5 11] "service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable"][[22 5 12] "time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,"][[22 5 13] "having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they"][[22 5 14] "quit the ship for good with the pilot."][[22 6 1] "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain"][[22 6 2] "Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and"][[22 6 3] "commanding, and not Bildad."][[22 7 1] "\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered at"][[22 7 2] "the main-mast. \"Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.\""][[22 8 1] "\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this"][[22 8 2] "whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the"][[22 8 3] "Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to"][[22 8 4] "be the next thing to heaving up the anchor."][[22 9 1] "\"Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!--jump!\"--was the next command, and"][[22 9 2] "the crew sprang for the handspikes."][[22 10 1] "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot"][[22 10 2] "is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it"][[22 10 3] "known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots"][[22 10 4] "of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in"][[22 10 5] "order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned"][[22 10 6] "in, for he never piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now"][[22 10 7] "be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching"][[22 10 8] "anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,"][[22 10 9] "to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of"][[22 10 10] "a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will."][[22 10 11] "Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no"][[22 10 12] "profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in"][[22 10 13] "getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice"][[22 10 14] "copy of Watts in each seaman's berth."][[22 11 1] "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped"][[22 11 2] "and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would"][[22 11 3] "sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused"][[22 11 4] "on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the"][[22 11 5] "perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a"][[22 11 6] "pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious"][[22 11 7] "Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and"][[22 11 8] "seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and"][[22 11 9] "turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the"][[22 11 10] "act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first"][[22 11 11] "kick."][[22 12 1] "\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared."][[22 12 2] "\"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!

Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and"][[26 2 24] "endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his"][[26 2 25] "life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that"][[26 2 26] "sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to"][[26 2 27] "spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents"][[26 2 28] "and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the"][[26 2 29] "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories"][[26 2 30] "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the"][[26 2 31] "original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those"][[26 2 32] "latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush"][[26 2 33] "of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous"][[26 2 34] "vicissitudes of the fishery. \"I will have no man in my boat,\" said"][[26 2 35] "Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\" By this, he seemed to mean,"][[26 2 36] "not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises"][[26 2 37] "from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly"][[26 2 38] "fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward."][[26 3 1] "\"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as careful"][[26 3 2] "a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.\" But we shall ere long"][[26 3 3] "see what that word \"careful\" precisely means when used by a man like"][[26 3 4] "Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter."][[26 4 1] "Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a"][[26 4 2] "sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all"][[26 4 3] "mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this"][[26 4 4] "business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of"][[26 4 5] "the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted."][[26 4 6] "Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor"][[26 4 7] "for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting"][[26 4 8] "him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill"][[26 4 9] "whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that"][[26 4 10] "hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was"][[26 4 11] "his own father's? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn"][[26 4 12] "limbs of his brother?"][[26 5 1] "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain"][[26 5 2] "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which"][[26 5 3] "could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But"][[26 5 4] "it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such"][[26 5 5] "terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature"][[26 5 6] "that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in"][[26 5 7] "him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its"][[26 5 8] "confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it"][[26 5 9] "was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,"][[26 5 10] "while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or"][[26 5 11] "whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet"][[26 5 12] "cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,"][[26 5 13] "which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and"][[26 5 14] "mighty man."][[26 6 1] "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete"][[26 6 2] "abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to"][[26 6 3] "write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose"][[26 6 4] "the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint"][[26 6 5] "stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;"][[26 6 6] "men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble"][[26 6 7] "and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any"][[26 6 8] "ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their"][[26 6 9] "costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves,"][[26 6 10] "so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character"][[26 6 11] "seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of"][[26 6 12] "a valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,"][[26 6 13] "completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this"][[26 6 14] "august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but"][[26 6 15] "that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it"][[26 6 16] "shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic"][[26 6 17] "dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The"][[26 6 18] "great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His"][[26 6 19] "omnipresence, our divine equality!"][[26 7 1] "If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall"][[26 7 2] "hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic"][[26 7 3] "graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them"][[26 7 4] "all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch"][[26 7 5] "that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow"][[26 7 6] "over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear"][[26 7 7] "me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal"][[26 7 8] "mantle of humanity over all my kind!

Thou who, in all"][[26 7 14] "Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from"][[26 7 15] "the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!"][[27 0 0] "CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires."][[27 2 1] "Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,"][[27 2 2] "according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;"][[27 2 3] "neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an"][[27 2 4] "indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the"][[27 2 5] "chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged"][[27 2 6] "for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his"][[27 2 7] "whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his"][[27 2 8] "crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable"][[27 2 9] "arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the"][[27 2 10] "snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of"][[27 2 11] "the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as"][[27 2 12] "a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes"][[27 2 13] "while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had,"][[27 2 14] "for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he"][[27 2 15] "thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of"][[27 2 16] "it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his"][[27 2 17] "mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,"][[27 2 18] "he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir"][[27 2 19] "themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed"][[27 2 20] "the order, and not sooner."][[27 3 1] "What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,"][[27 3 2] "unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a"][[27 3 3] "world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;"][[27 3 4] "what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that"][[27 3 5] "thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black"][[27 3 6] "little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would"][[27 3 7] "almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his"][[27 3 8] "nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready"][[27 3 9] "loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he"][[27 3 10] "turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from"][[27 3 11] "the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in"][[27 3 12] "readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his"][[27 3 13] "legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth."][[27 4 1] "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his"][[27 4 2] "peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether"][[27 4 3] "ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of"][[27 4 4] "the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the"][[27 4 5] "cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their"][[27 4 6] "mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco"][[27 4 7] "smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent."][[27 5 1] "The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard. A"][[27 5 2] "short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,"][[27 5 3] "who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally"][[27 5 4] "and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of"][[27 5 5] "honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost"][[27 5 6] "was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic"][[27 5 7] "bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of"][[27 5 8] "any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,"][[27 5 9] "the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least"][[27 5 10] "water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small"][[27 5 11] "application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This"][[27 5 12] "ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in"][[27 5 13] "the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a"][[27 5 14] "three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted"][[27 5 15] "that length of time. As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought"][[27 5 16] "nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask"][[27 5 17] "was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They"][[27 5 18] "called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could"][[27 5 19] "be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic"][[27 5 20] "whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted"][[27 5 21] "into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those"][[27 5 22] "battering seas."][[27 6 1] "Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous"][[27 6 2] "men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the"][[27 6 3] "Pequod's boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which"][[27 6 4] "Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,"][[27 6 5] "these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with"][[27 6 6] "their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;"][[27 6 7] "even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins."][[27 7 1] "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic"][[27 7 2] "Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,"][[27 7 3] "who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when"][[27 7 4] "the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and"][[27 7 5] "moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy"][[27 7 6] "and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set"][[27 7 7] "down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of"][[27 7 8] "them belonged."][[27 8 1] "First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected"][[27 8 2] "for his squire. But Queequeg is already known."][[27 9 1] "Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly"][[27 9 2] "promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last"][[27 9 3] "remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring"][[27 9 4] "island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the"][[27 9 5] "fishery, they usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego's"][[27 9 6] "long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding"][[27 9 7] "eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their"][[27 9 8] "glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor"][[27 9 9] "of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest"][[27 9 10] "of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal"][[27 9 11] "forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild"][[27 9 12] "beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great"][[27 9 13] "whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the"][[27 9 14] "infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe"][[27 9 15] "snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of"][[27 9 16] "the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son"][[27 9 17] "of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second"][[27 9 18] "mate's squire."][[27 10 1] "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black"][[27 10 2] "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended"][[27 10 3] "from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called"][[27 10 4] "them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to"][[27 10 5] "them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,"][[27 10 6] "lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been"][[27 10 7] "anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors"][[27 10 8] "most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold"][[27 10 9] "life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what"][[27 10 10] "manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,"][[27 10 11] "and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six"][[27 10 12] "feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at"][[27 10 13] "him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to"][[27 10 14] "beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus"][[27 10 15] "Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man"][[27 10 16] "beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said, that"][[27 10 17] "at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the"][[27 10 18] "mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born, though"][[27 10 19] "pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the"][[27 10 20] "American whale fishery as with the American army and military and"][[27 10 21] "merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction"][[27 10 22] "of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all"][[27 10 23] "these cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest"][[27 10 24] "of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of"][[27 10 25] "these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound"][[27 10 26] "Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy"][[27 10 27] "peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers"][[27 10 28] "sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to"][[27 10 29] "receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards,"][[27 10 30] "they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but"][[27 10 31] "Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders"][[27 10 32] "in the Pequod, ISOLATOES too, I call such, not acknowledging the common"][[27 10 33] "continent of men, but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his"][[27 10 34] "own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!"][[27 10 35] "An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all"][[27 10 36] "the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the"][[27 10 37] "world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever"][[27 10 38] "come back. Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went before. Poor"][[27 10 39] "Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him,"][[27 10 40] "beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for,"][[27 10 41] "to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and"][[27 10 42] "beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!"][[28 0 0] "CHAPTER 28. Ahab."][[28 2 1] "For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen"][[28 2 2] "of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,"][[28 2 3] "and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the"][[28 2 4] "only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin"][[28 2 5] "with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they"][[28 2 6] "but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was"][[28 2 7] "there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate"][[28 2 8] "into the now sacred retreat of the cabin."][[28 3 1] "Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly"][[28 3 2] "gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague"][[28 3 3] "disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the"][[28 3 4] "sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened"][[28 3 5] "at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly"][[28 3 6] "recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived"][[28 3 7] "of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was"][[28 3 8] "almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish"][[28 3 9] "prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or"][[28 3 10] "uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet whenever I came to look"][[28 3 11] "about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such"][[28 3 12] "emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,"][[28 3 13] "were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the"][[28 3 14] "tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me"][[28 3 15] "acquainted with, still I ascribed this--and rightly ascribed it--to the"][[28 3 16] "fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation"][[28 3 17] "in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect"][[28 3 18] "of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most"][[28 3 19] "forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce"][[28 3 20] "confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three"][[28 3 21] "better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,"][[28 3 22] "could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a"][[28 3 23] "Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the"][[28 3 24] "ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather,"][[28 3 25] "though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every"][[28 3 26] "degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that"][[28 3 27] "merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one"][[28 3 28] "of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the"][[28 3 29] "transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water"][[28 3 30] "with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I"][[28 3 31] "mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I"][[28 3 32] "levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me."][[28 3 33] "Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck."][[28 4 1] "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the"][[28 4 2] "recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when"][[28 4 3] "the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,"][[28 4 4] "or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His"][[28 4 5] "whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an"][[28 4 6] "unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading its way out"][[28 4 7] "from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his"][[28 4 8] "tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,"][[28 4 9] "you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that"][[28 4 10] "perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of"][[28 4 11] "a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and"][[28 4 12] "without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top"][[28 4 13] "to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly"][[28 4 14] "alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it"][[28 4 15] "was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say."][[28 4 16] "By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was"][[28 4 17] "made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old"][[28 4 18] "Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till"][[28 4 19] "he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and"][[28 4 20] "then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in"][[28 4 21] "an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially"][[28 4 22] "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,"][[28 4 23] "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this"][[28 4 24] "laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the"][[28 4 25] "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with"][[28 4 26] "preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously"][[28 4 27] "contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should"][[28 4 28] "be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he"][[28 4 29] "muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would"][[28 4 30] "find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole."][[28 5 1] "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid"][[28 5 2] "brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted"][[28 5 3] "that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric"][[28 5 4] "white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that"][[28 5 5] "this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of"][[28 5 6] "the sperm whale's jaw. \"Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,\" said the old"][[28 5 7] "Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another"][[28 5 8] "mast without coming home for it.

I promise nothing complete;"][[32 10 6] "because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very"][[32 10 7] "reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical"][[32 10 8] "description of the various species, or--in this place at least--to much"][[32 10 9] "of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a"][[32 10 10] "systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder."][[32 11 1] "But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office"][[32 11 2] "is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them;"][[32 11 3] "to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very"][[32 11 4] "pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should"][[32 11 5] "essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job"][[32 11 6] "might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee?"][[32 11 7] "Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and"][[32 11 8] "sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible"][[32 11 9] "hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to"][[32 11 10] "settle."][[32 12 1] "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology"][[32 12 2] "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it"][[32 12 3] "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of"][[32 12 4] "Nature, A.D. , Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from"][[32 12 5] "the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year ,"][[32 12 6] "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict,"][[32 12 7] "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the"][[32 12 8] "Leviathan."][[32 13 1] "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from"][[32 13 2] "the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular"][[32 13 3] "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem"][[32 13 4] "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex lege naturae jure"][[32 13 5] "meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley"][[32 13 6] "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and"][[32 13 7] "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether"][[32 13 8] "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug."][[32 14 1] "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned"][[32 14 2] "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me."][[32 14 3] "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal"][[32 14 4] "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given"][[32 14 5] "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;"][[32 14 6] "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded."][[32 15 1] "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as"][[32 15 2] "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a"][[32 15 3] "whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have"][[32 15 4] "him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded"][[32 15 5] "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a"][[32 15 6] "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is"][[32 15 7] "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have"][[32 15 8] "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a"][[32 15 9] "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,"][[32 15 10] "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal"][[32 15 11] "position."][[32 16 1] "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude"][[32 16 2] "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified"][[32 16 3] "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other"][[32 16 4] "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*"][[32 16 5] "Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be"][[32 16 6] "included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand"][[32 16 7] "divisions of the entire whale host."][[32 18 1] "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and"][[32 18 2] "Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included"][[32 18 3] "by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,"][[32 18 4] "contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on"][[32 18 5] "wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials"][[32 18 6] "as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the"][[32 18 7] "Kingdom of Cetology."][[32 20 1] "First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary"][[32 20 2] "BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all,"][[32 20 3] "both small and large."][[32 21 1] "I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE."][[32 22 1] "As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO, the"][[32 22 2] "GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE."][[32 23 1] "FOLIOS.

(SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the"][[32 24 2] "English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter"][[32 24 3] "whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the"][[32 24 4] "French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the"][[32 24 5] "Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;"][[32 24 6] "the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in"][[32 24 7] "aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being"][[32 24 8] "the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is"][[32 24 9] "obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged"][[32 24 10] "upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically"][[32 24 11] "considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was"][[32 24 12] "almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil"][[32 24 13] "was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days"][[32 24 14] "spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a"][[32 24 15] "creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland"][[32 24 16] "or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that"][[32 24 17] "quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of"][[32 24 18] "the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was"][[32 24 19] "exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment"][[32 24 20] "and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays"][[32 24 21] "buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the"][[32 24 22] "true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still"][[32 24 23] "retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so"][[32 24 24] "strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at"][[32 24 25] "last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti"][[32 24 26] "was really derived."][[32 25 1] "BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is the"][[32 25 2] "most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted"][[32 25 3] "by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and"][[32 25 4] "the oil specially known as \"whale oil,\" an inferior article in commerce."][[32 25 5] "Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the"][[32 25 6] "following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale;"][[32 25 7] "the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of"][[32 25 8] "obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously"][[32 25 9] "baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species"][[32 25 10] "of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the"][[32 25 11] "Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the"][[32 25 12] "French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale"][[32 25 13] "which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and"][[32 25 14] "English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen"][[32 25 15] "have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor'"][[32 25 16] "West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them"][[32 25 17] "Right Whale Cruising Grounds."][[32 26 1] "Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the"][[32 26 2] "English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree"][[32 26 3] "in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single"][[32 26 4] "determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by"][[32 26 5] "endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that"][[32 26 6] "some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The"][[32 26 7] "right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference"][[32 26 8] "to elucidating the sperm whale."][[32 27 1] "BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon"][[32 27 2] "a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and"][[32 27 3] "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale"][[32 27 4] "whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the"][[32 27 5] "Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and"][[32 27 6] "in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less"][[32 27 7] "portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips"][[32 27 8] "present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds"][[32 27 9] "of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which"][[32 27 10] "he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some"][[32 27 11] "three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the"][[32 27 12] "back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if"][[32 27 13] "not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated"][[32 27 14] "fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When"][[32 27 15] "the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,"][[32 27 16] "and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled"][[32 27 17] "surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it"][[32 27 18] "somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on"][[32 27 19] "it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not"][[32 27 20] "gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very"][[32 27 21] "shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the"][[32 27 22] "remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet"][[32 27 23] "rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with"][[32 27 24] "such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present"][[32 27 25] "pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable"][[32 27 26] "Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From"][[32 27 27] "having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with"][[32 27 28] "the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,"][[32 27 29] "that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there"][[32 27 30] "would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little"][[32 27 31] "known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched"][[32 27 32] "whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's"][[32 27 33] "names for a few sorts."][[32 28 1] "In connection with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of"][[32 28 2] "great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be"][[32 28 3] "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is"][[32 28 4] "in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon"][[32 28 5] "either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those"][[32 28 6] "marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford"][[32 28 7] "the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached"][[32 28 8] "bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How"][[32 28 9] "then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose"][[32 28 10] "peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,"][[32 28 11] "without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other"][[32 28 12] "and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked"][[32 28 13] "whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same"][[32 28 14] "humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen;"][[32 28 15] "but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the"][[32 28 16] "other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such"][[32 28 17] "irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,"][[32 28 18] "such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general"][[32 28 19] "methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the"][[32 28 20] "whale-naturalists has split."][[32 29 1] "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the"][[32 29 2] "whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the"][[32 29 3] "right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the"][[32 29 4] "Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have"][[32 29 5] "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the"][[32 29 6] "Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various"][[32 29 7] "leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as"][[32 29 8] "available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated."][[32 29 9] "What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in"][[32 29 10] "their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is"][[32 29 11] "the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can"][[32 29 12] "possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed."][[32 30 1] "BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on"][[32 30 2] "the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and"][[32 30 3] "towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you"][[32 30 4] "might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular"][[32 30 5] "name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm"][[32 30 6] "whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very"][[32 30 7] "valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of"][[32 30 8] "all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any"][[32 30 9] "other of them."][[32 31 1] "BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is known"][[32 31 2] "but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring"][[32 31 3] "nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he"][[32 31 4] "has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long"][[32 31 5] "sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody"][[32 31 6] "else."][[32 32 1] "BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring"][[32 32 2] "gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the"][[32 32 3] "Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;"][[32 32 4] "at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas,"][[32 32 5] "and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is"][[32 32 6] "never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are"][[32 32 7] "told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true"][[32 32 8] "of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer."][[32 33 1] "Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO)."][[32 34 1] "OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which"][[32 34 2] "present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH; III.,"][[32 34 3] "the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER."][[32 36 1] "*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain."][[32 36 2] "Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of"][[32 36 3] "the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them"][[32 36 4] "in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form"][[32 36 5] "does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume"][[32 36 6] "does."][[32 38 1] "BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose"][[32 38 2] "loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb"][[32 38 3] "to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not"][[32 38 4] "popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive"][[32 38 5] "features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one."][[32 38 6] "He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet"][[32 38 7] "in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in"][[32 38 8] "herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in"][[32 38 9] "quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is"][[32 38 10] "regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale."][[32 39 1] "BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular"][[32 39 2] "fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best."][[32 39 3] "Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so,"][[32 39 4] "and suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,"][[32 39 5] "because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the"][[32 39 6] "Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the"][[32 39 7] "circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he"][[32 39 8] "carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale"][[32 39 9] "averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost"][[32 39 10] "all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin"][[32 39 11] "in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more"][[32 39 12] "profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena"][[32 39 13] "whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as"][[32 39 14] "some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by"][[32 39 15] "themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their"][[32 39 16] "blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of"][[32 39 17] "thirty gallons of oil."][[32 40 1] "BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL"][[32 40 2] "WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose"][[32 40 3] "from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The"][[32 40 4] "creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five"][[32 40 5] "feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly"][[32 40 6] "speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw"][[32 40 7] "in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only"][[32 40 8] "found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner"][[32 40 9] "something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What"][[32 40 10] "precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to"][[32 40 11] "say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and"][[32 40 12] "bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for"][[32 40 13] "a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin"][[32 40 14] "said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the"][[32 40 15] "surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his"][[32 40 16] "horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these"][[32 40 17] "surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided"][[32 40 18] "horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would"][[32 40 19] "certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets."][[32 40 20] "The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and"][[32 40 21] "the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism"][[32 40 22] "to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain"][[32 40 23] "cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn"][[32 40 24] "was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison,"][[32 40 25] "and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also"][[32 40 26] "distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the"][[32 40 27] "horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it"][[32 40 28] "was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells"][[32 40 29] "me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when"][[32 40 30] "Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window"][[32 40 31] "of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; \"when Sir"][[32 40 32] "Martin returned from that voyage,\" saith Black Letter, \"on bended knees"][[32 40 33] "he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,"][[32 40 34] "which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.\" An Irish"][[32 40 35] "author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise"][[32 40 36] "present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the"][[32 40 37] "unicorn nature."][[32 41 1] "The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a"][[32 41 2] "milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black."][[32 41 3] "His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and"][[32 41 4] "he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas."][[32 42 1] "BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is"][[32 42 2] "precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed"][[32 42 3] "naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say"][[32 42 4] "that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage--a sort of"][[32 42 5] "Feegee fish.

I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception"][[32 42 8] "might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground"][[32 42 9] "of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea;"][[32 42 10] "Bonapartes and Sharks included."][[32 43 1] "BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V.

He mounts"][[32 43 3] "the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by"][[32 43 4] "flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar"][[32 43 5] "process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both"][[32 43 6] "are outlaws, even in the lawless seas."][[32 44 1] "Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III.

The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise."][[32 46 1] "To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may"][[32 46 2] "possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five"][[32 46 3] "feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the popular"][[32 46 4] "sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set"][[32 46 5] "down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my"][[32 46 6] "definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal"][[32 46 7] "tail."][[32 47 1] "BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER . (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the"][[32 47 2] "common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own"][[32 47 3] "bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something"][[32 47 4] "must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always"][[32 47 5] "swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing"][[32 47 6] "themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their"][[32 47 7] "appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine"][[32 47 8] "spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They"][[32 47 9] "are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a"][[32 47 10] "lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding"][[32 47 11] "these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly"][[32 47 12] "gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will"][[32 47 13] "yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid"][[32 47 14] "extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among"][[32 47 15] "jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise"][[32 47 16] "meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that"][[32 47 17] "a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very"][[32 47 18] "readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and"][[32 47 19] "you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature."][[32 48 1] "BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate. Very"][[32 48 2] "savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger"][[32 48 3] "than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.

The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated,"][[32 49 4] "is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that"][[32 49 5] "he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs"][[32 49 6] "in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly"][[32 49 7] "girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has"][[32 49 8] "no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail,"][[32 49 9] "and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils"][[32 49 10] "all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable,"][[32 49 11] "yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called"][[32 49 12] "the \"bright waist,\" that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two"][[32 49 13] "separate colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part"][[32 49 14] "of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he"][[32 49 15] "had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and"][[32 49 16] "mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise."][[32 51 1] "Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as"][[32 51 2] "the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the"][[32 51 3] "Leviathans of note.

I shall enumerate them by their"][[32 51 6] "fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to"][[32 51 7] "future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If"][[32 51 8] "any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then"][[32 51 9] "he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio,"][[32 51 10] "Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale;"][[32 51 11] "the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon"][[32 51 12] "Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the"][[32 51 13] "Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,"][[32 51 14] "Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of"][[32 51 15] "uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names.

Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!"][[33 0 0] "CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder."][[33 2 1] "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place"][[33 2 2] "as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising"][[33 2 3] "from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown"][[33 2 4] "of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet."][[33 3 1] "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced"][[33 3 2] "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries"][[33 3 3] "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in"][[33 3 4] "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an"][[33 3 5] "officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;"][[33 3 6] "usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In"][[33 3 7] "those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation"][[33 3 8] "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting"][[33 3 9] "department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer"][[33 3 10] "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted"][[33 3 11] "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but"][[33 3 12] "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply"][[33 3 13] "as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more"][[33 3 14] "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the"][[33 3 15] "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since"][[33 3 16] "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,"][[33 3 17] "but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the"][[33 3 18] "command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political"][[33 3 19] "maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from"][[33 3 20] "the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their"][[33 3 21] "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as"][[33 3 22] "their social equal."][[33 4 1] "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is"][[33 4 2] "this--the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and"][[33 4 3] "merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and"][[33 4 4] "so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in"][[33 4 5] "the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the"][[33 4 6] "captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it."][[33 5 1] "Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest"][[33 5 2] "of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and"][[33 5 3] "the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high"][[33 5 4] "or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their"][[33 5 5] "common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and"][[33 5 6] "hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less"][[33 5 7] "rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind"][[33 5 8] "how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some"][[33 5 9] "primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious"][[33 5 10] "externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,"][[33 5 11] "and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in"][[33 5 12] "which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated"][[33 5 13] "grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost"][[33 5 14] "as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the"][[33 5 15] "shabbiest of pilot-cloth."][[33 6 1] "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least"][[33 6 2] "given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage"][[33 6 3] "he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he"][[33 6 4] "required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon"][[33 6 5] "the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar"][[33 6 6] "circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he"][[33 6 7] "addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or IN"][[33 6 8] "TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means"][[33 6 9] "unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea."][[33 7 1] "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those"][[33 7 2] "forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally"][[33 7 3] "making use of them for other and more private ends than they were"][[33 7 4] "legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,"][[33 7 5] "which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through"][[33 7 6] "those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible"][[33 7 7] "dictatorship. For be a man's intellectual superiority what it will,"][[33 7 8] "it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,"][[33 7 9] "without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always,"][[33 7 10] "in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever"][[33 7 11] "keeps God's true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and"][[33 7 12] "leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who"][[33 7 13] "become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice"][[33 7 14] "hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted"][[33 7 15] "superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks"][[33 7 16] "in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,"][[33 7 17] "that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted"][[33 7 18] "potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown"][[33 7 19] "of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian"][[33 7 20] "herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the"][[33 7 21] "tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest"][[33 7 22] "sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in"][[33 7 23] "his art, as the one now alluded to."][[33 8 1] "But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket"][[33 8 2] "grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and"][[33 8 3] "Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old"][[33 8 4] "whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings"][[33 8 5] "and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it"][[33 8 6] "must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and"][[33 8 7] "featured in the unbodied air!"][[34 0 0] "CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table."][[34 2 1] "It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread"][[34 2 2] "face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and"][[34 2 3] "master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an"][[34 2 4] "observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the"][[34 2 5] "smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on"][[34 2 6] "the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the"][[34 2 7] "tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But"][[34 2 8] "presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to"][[34 2 9] "the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \"Dinner, Mr."][[34 2 10] "Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin."][[34 3 1] "When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the"][[34 3 2] "first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck"][[34 3 3] "rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after"][[34 3 4] "a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,"][[34 3 5] "\"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges"][[34 3 6] "about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to"][[34 3 7] "see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise"][[34 3 8] "takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows"][[34 3 9] "after his predecessors."][[34 4 1] "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,"][[34 4 2] "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all"][[34 4 3] "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his"][[34 4 4] "shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right"][[34 4 5] "over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching"][[34 4 6] "his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so"][[34 4 7] "far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other"][[34 4 8] "processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into"][[34 4 9] "the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,"][[34 4 10] "then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab's presence,"][[34 4 11] "in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave."][[34 5 1] "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense"][[34 5 2] "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck"][[34 5 3] "some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and"][[34 5 4] "defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those"][[34 5 5] "very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that"][[34 5 6] "same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say"][[34 5 7] "deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of"][[34 5 8] "the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this"][[34 5 9] "difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of"][[34 5 10] "Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,"][[34 5 11] "therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he"][[34 5 12] "who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own"][[34 5 13] "private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's unchallenged power"][[34 5 14] "and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man's royalty of"][[34 5 15] "state transcends Belshazzar's, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who"][[34 5 16] "has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar. It"][[34 5 17] "is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now,"][[34 5 18] "if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a"][[34 5 19] "ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that"][[34 5 20] "peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned."][[34 6 1] "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned"][[34 6 2] "sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still"][[34 6 3] "deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be"][[34 6 4] "served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,"][[34 6 5] "there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,"][[34 6 6] "their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he carved"][[34 6 7] "the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they"][[34 6 8] "would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even"][[34 6 9] "upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his"][[34 6 10] "knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby"][[34 6 11] "motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as"][[34 6 12] "though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started"][[34 6 13] "if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it"][[34 6 14] "noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like"][[34 6 15] "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly"][[34 6 16] "dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were"][[34 6 17] "somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab"][[34 6 18] "forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was"][[34 6 19] "to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And"][[34 6 20] "poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary"][[34 6 21] "family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have"][[34 6 22] "been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this"][[34 6 23] "must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had"][[34 6 24] "he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have"][[34 6 25] "been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,"][[34 6 26] "strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,"][[34 6 27] "the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did"][[34 6 28] "Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners"][[34 6 29] "of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,"][[34 6 30] "sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such"][[34 6 31] "marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for"][[34 6 32] "him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!"][[34 7 1] "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask"][[34 7 2] "is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was badly"][[34 7 3] "jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;"][[34 7 4] "and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb"][[34 7 5] "even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small"][[34 7 6] "appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask"][[34 7 7] "must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;"][[34 7 8] "for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck."][[34 7 9] "Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he"][[34 7 10] "had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never"][[34 7 11] "known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what"][[34 7 12] "he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him."][[34 7 13] "Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from"][[34 7 14] "my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of"][[34 7 15] "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the"][[34 7 16] "mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:"][[34 7 17] "there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere"][[34 7 18] "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official"][[34 7 19] "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,"][[34 7 20] "was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin"][[34 7 21] "sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab."][[34 8 1] "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table"][[34 8 2] "in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted"][[34 8 3] "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was"][[34 8 4] "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three"][[34 8 5] "harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees."][[34 8 6] "They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty"][[34 8 7] "cabin."][[34 9 1] "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless"][[34 9 2] "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free"][[34 9 3] "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows"][[34 9 4] "the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the"][[34 9 5] "sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food"][[34 9 6] "with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;"][[34 9 7] "they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices."][[34 9 8] "Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out"][[34 9 9] "the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was"][[34 9 10] "fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of"][[34 9 11] "the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with"][[34 9 12] "a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of"][[34 9 13] "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once"][[34 9 14] "Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by"][[34 9 15] "snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty"][[34 9 16] "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the"][[34 9 17] "circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,"][[34 9 18] "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny"][[34 9 19] "of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing"][[34 9 20] "spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous"][[34 9 21] "visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one"][[34 9 22] "continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished"][[34 9 23] "with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into"][[34 9 24] "his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the"][[34 9 25] "blinds of its door, till all was over."][[34 10 1] "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing"][[34 10 2] "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the"][[34 10 3] "floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low"][[34 10 4] "carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin"][[34 10 5] "framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a"][[34 10 6] "ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,"][[34 10 7] "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively"][[34 10 8] "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,"][[34 10 9] "baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed"][[34 10 10] "strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his"][[34 10 11] "dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by"][[34 10 12] "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a"][[34 10 13] "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so"][[34 10 14] "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether"][[34 10 15] "any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear"][[34 10 16] "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be"][[34 10 17] "picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging"][[34 10 18] "round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the"][[34 10 19] "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their"][[34 10 20] "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they"][[34 10 21] "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at"][[34 10 22] "all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his"][[34 10 23] "Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some"][[34 10 24] "murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the"][[34 10 25] "white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on"][[34 10 26] "his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,"][[34 10 27] "the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,"][[34 10 28] "fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every"][[34 10 29] "step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards."][[34 11 1] "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived"][[34 11 2] "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were"][[34 11 3] "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,"][[34 11 4] "when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters."][[34 12 1] "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale"][[34 12 2] "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights"][[34 12 3] "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that"][[34 12 4] "anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,"][[34 12 5] "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to"][[34 12 6] "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it"][[34 12 7] "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for"][[34 12 8] "a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,"][[34 12 9] "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin"][[34 12 10] "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally"][[34 12 11] "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He"][[34 12 12] "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled"][[34 12 13] "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of"][[34 12 14] "the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter"][[34 12 15] "there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,"][[34 12 16] "Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the"][[34 12 17] "sullen paws of its gloom!"][[35 0 0] "CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head."][[35 2 1] "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the"][[35 2 2] "other seamen my first mast-head came round."][[35 3 1] "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost"][[35 3 2] "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may"][[35 3 3] "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper"][[35 3 4] "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage"][[35 3 5] "she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial"][[35 3 6] "even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her"][[35 3 7] "skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether"][[35 3 8] "relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more."][[35 4 1] "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very"][[35 4 2] "ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here."][[35 4 3] "I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old"][[35 4 4] "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them."][[35 4 5] "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by"][[35 4 6] "their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,"][[35 4 7] "or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great"][[35 4 8] "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread"][[35 4 9] "gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders"][[35 4 10] "priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of"][[35 4 11] "mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among"][[35 4 12] "archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical"][[35 4 13] "purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like"][[35 4 14] "formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious"][[35 4 15] "long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount"][[35 4 16] "to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a"][[35 4 17] "modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In"][[35 4 18] "Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him"][[35 4 19] "a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of"][[35 4 20] "his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a"][[35 4 21] "tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless"][[35 4 22] "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs"][[35 4 23] "or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to"][[35 4 24] "the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads"][[35 4 25] "we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,"][[35 4 26] "though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely"][[35 4 27] "incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange"][[35 4 28] "sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,"][[35 4 29] "stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;"][[35 4 30] "careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis"][[35 4 31] "Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on"][[35 4 32] "his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars,"][[35 4 33] "his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals"][[35 4 34] "will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his"][[35 4 35] "mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that"][[35 4 36] "London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for"][[35 4 37] "where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor"][[35 4 38] "Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however"][[35 4 39] "madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks"][[35 4 40] "upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits"][[35 4 41] "penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals"][[35 4 42] "and what rocks must be shunned."][[35 5 1] "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head"][[35 5 2] "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is"][[35 5 3] "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole"][[35 5 4] "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,"][[35 5 5] "that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly"][[35 5 6] "launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty"][[35 5 7] "spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means"][[35 5 8] "of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few"][[35 5 9] "years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,"][[35 5 10] "who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh"][[35 5 11] "the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the"][[35 5 12] "one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads"][[35 5 13] "are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their"][[35 5 14] "regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two"][[35 5 15] "hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant"][[35 5 16] "the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There"][[35 5 17] "you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the"][[35 5 18] "deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and"][[35 5 19] "between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even"][[35 5 20] "as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old"][[35 5 21] "Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with"][[35 5 22] "nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the"][[35 5 23] "drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the"][[35 5 24] "most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests"][[35 5 25] "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts"][[35 5 26] "of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear"][[35 5 27] "of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are"][[35 5 28] "never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for"][[35 5 29] "all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and"][[35 5 30] "your bill of fare is immutable."][[35 6 1] "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'"][[35 6 2] "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the"][[35 6 3] "mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be"][[35 6 4] "deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion"][[35 6 5] "of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute"][[35 6 6] "of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a"][[35 6 7] "comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,"][[35 6 8] "a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small"][[35 6 9] "and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your"][[35 6 10] "most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you"][[35 6 11] "stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called"][[35 6 12] "the t' gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner"][[35 6 13] "feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure,"][[35 6 14] "in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of"][[35 6 15] "a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more"][[35 6 16] "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its"][[35 6 17] "fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out"][[35 6 18] "of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim"][[35 6 19] "crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of"][[35 6 20] "a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You"][[35 6 21] "cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you"][[35 6 22] "make a convenient closet of your watch-coat."][[35 7 1] "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a"][[35 7 2] "southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents"][[35 7 3] "or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a Greenland"][[35 7 4] "whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In"][[35 7 5] "the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \"A Voyage among the"][[35 7 6] "Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the"][[35 7 7] "re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\" in"][[35 7 8] "this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with"][[35 7 9] "a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented"][[35 7 10] "CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet's good"][[35 7 11] "craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he"][[35 7 12] "being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous"][[35 7 13] "false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our"][[35 7 14] "own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so"][[35 7 15] "likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we"][[35 7 16] "may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large"][[35 7 17] "tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with"][[35 7 18] "a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale."][[35 7 19] "Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a"][[35 7 20] "little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the"][[35 7 21] "stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for"][[35 7 22] "umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which"][[35 7 23] "to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical"][[35 7 24] "conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this"][[35 7 25] "crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him"][[35 7 26] "(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for"][[35 7 27] "the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns"][[35 7 28] "infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from"][[35 7 29] "the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon"][[35 7 30] "them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love"][[35 7 31] "for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed"][[35 7 32] "conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many"][[35 7 33] "of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his"][[35 7 34] "experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for"][[35 7 35] "the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called"][[35 7 36] "the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to"][[35 7 37] "the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the"][[35 7 38] "Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down"][[35 7 39] "blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very"][[35 7 40] "discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned \"binnacle"][[35 7 41] "deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\" and \"approximate errors,\""][[35 7 42] "he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed"][[35 7 43] "in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted"][[35 7 44] "occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely"][[35 7 45] "tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand."][[35 7 46] "Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the"][[35 7 47] "honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he"][[35 7 48] "should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend"][[35 7 49] "and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded"][[35 7 50] "head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest"][[35 7 51] "within three or four perches of the pole."][[35 8 1] "But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as"][[35 8 2] "Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is"][[35 8 3] "greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those"][[35 8 4] "seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used"][[35 8 5] "to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a"][[35 8 6] "chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;"][[35 8 7] "then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the"][[35 8 8] "top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at"][[35 8 9] "last mount to my ultimate destination."][[35 9 1] "Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but"][[35 9 2] "sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how"][[35 9 3] "could I--being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering"][[35 9 4] "altitude--how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all"][[35 9 5] "whale-ships' standing orders, \"Keep your weather eye open, and sing out"][[35 9 6] "every time.\""][[35 10 1] "And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of"][[35 10 2] "Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with"][[35 10 3] "lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who"][[35 10 4] "offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware"][[35 10 5] "of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be"][[35 10 6] "killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes"][[35 10 7] "round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer.

That to attempt it, would"][[41 9 8] "be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are"][[41 9 9] "some remarkable documents that may be consulted."][[41 10 1] "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things"][[41 10 2] "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,"][[41 10 3] "chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the"][[41 10 4] "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious"][[41 10 5] "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if"][[41 10 6] "offered."][[41 11 1] "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked"][[41 11 2] "with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,"][[41 11 3] "was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had"][[41 11 4] "actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same"][[41 11 5] "instant of time."][[41 12 1] "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether"][[41 12 2] "without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets"][[41 12 3] "of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to"][[41 12 4] "the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale"][[41 12 5] "when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his"][[41 12 6] "pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and"][[41 12 7] "contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the"][[41 12 8] "mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports"][[41 12 9] "himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points."][[41 13 1] "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and"][[41 13 2] "as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,"][[41 13 3] "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose"][[41 13 4] "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland"][[41 13 5] "seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has"][[41 13 6] "been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could"][[41 13 7] "not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been"][[41 13 8] "believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem"][[41 13 9] "to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real"][[41 13 10] "living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of"][[41 13 11] "the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said"][[41 13 12] "to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);"][[41 13 13] "and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near"][[41 13 14] "Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land"][[41 13 15] "by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully"][[41 13 16] "equalled by the realities of the whalemen."][[41 14 1] "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing"][[41 14 2] "that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped"][[41 14 3] "alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should"][[41 14 4] "go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only"][[41 14 5] "ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that"][[41 14 6] "though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still"][[41 14 7] "swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick"][[41 14 8] "blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in"][[41 14 9] "unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would"][[41 14 10] "once more be seen."][[41 15 1] "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in"][[41 15 2] "the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike"][[41 15 3] "the imagination with unwonted power.

These were his prominent"][[41 15 7] "features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he"][[41 15 8] "revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him."][[41 16 1] "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with"][[41 16 2] "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive"][[41 16 3] "appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by"][[41 16 4] "his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue"][[41 16 5] "sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden"][[41 16 6] "gleamings."][[41 17 1] "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his"][[41 17 2] "deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,"][[41 17 3] "as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific"][[41 17 4] "accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than"][[41 17 5] "all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught"][[41 17 6] "else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every"][[41 17 7] "apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn"][[41 17 8] "round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to"][[41 17 9] "splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship."][[41 18 1] "Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar"][[41 18 2] "disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual"][[41 18 3] "in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's"][[41 18 4] "infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death"][[41 18 5] "that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an"][[41 18 6] "unintelligent agent."][[41 19 1] "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of"][[41 19 2] "his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed"][[41 19 3] "boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the"][[41 19 4] "white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating"][[41 19 5] "sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal."][[41 20 1] "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the"][[41 20 2] "eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had"][[41 20 3] "dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking"][[41 20 4] "with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale."][[41 20 5] "That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his"][[41 20 6] "sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's"][[41 20 7] "leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no"][[41 20 8] "hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice."][[41 20 9] "Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal"][[41 20 10] "encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,"][[41 20 11] "all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came"][[41 20 12] "to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his"][[41 20 13] "intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before"][[41 20 14] "him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which"][[41 20 15] "some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with"][[41 20 16] "half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been"][[41 20 17] "from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe"][[41 20 18] "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced"][[41 20 19] "in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;"][[41 20 20] "but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he"][[41 20 21] "pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and"][[41 20 22] "torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice"][[41 20 23] "in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle"][[41 20 24] "demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly"][[41 20 25] "personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon"][[41 20 26] "the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt"][[41 20 27] "by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a"][[41 20 28] "mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it."][[41 21 1] "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at"][[41 21 2] "the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the"][[41 21 3] "monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,"][[41 21 4] "corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he"][[41 21 5] "probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more."][[41 21 6] "Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long"][[41 21 7] "months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one"][[41 21 8] "hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;"][[41 21 9] "then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;"][[41 21 10] "and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward"][[41 21 11] "voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems"][[41 21 12] "all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,"][[41 21 13] "he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital"][[41 21 14] "strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified"][[41 21 15] "by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even"][[41 21 16] "there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung"][[41 21 17] "to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable"][[41 21 18] "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the"][[41 21 19] "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed"][[41 21 20] "left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his"][[41 21 21] "dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that"][[41 21 22] "firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once"][[41 21 23] "again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even"][[41 21 24] "then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a"][[41 21 25] "cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but"][[41 21 26] "become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy"][[41 21 27] "subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,"][[41 21 28] "when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the"][[41 21 29] "Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of"][[41 21 30] "Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not"][[41 21 31] "one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living"][[41 21 32] "agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may"][[41 21 33] "stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,"][[41 21 34] "and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far"][[41 21 35] "from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a"][[41 21 36] "thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon"][[41 21 37] "any one reasonable object."][[41 22 1] "This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted."][[41 22 2] "But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding"][[41 22 3] "far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where"][[41 22 4] "we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your"][[41 22 5] "way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;"][[41 22 6] "where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root"][[41 22 7] "of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique"][[41 22 8] "buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken"][[41 22 9] "throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he"][[41 22 10] "patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of"][[41 22 11] "ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,"][[41 22 12] "sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled"][[41 22 13] "royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come."][[41 23 1] "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means"][[41 23 2] "are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or"][[41 23 3] "change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long"][[41 23 4] "dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling"][[41 23 5] "was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate."][[41 23 6] "Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when"][[41 23 7] "with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him"][[41 23 8] "otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the"][[41 23 9] "terrible casualty which had overtaken him."][[41 24 1] "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly"][[41 24 2] "ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which"][[41 24 3] "always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the"][[41 24 4] "present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,"][[41 24 5] "that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on"][[41 24 6] "account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent"][[41 24 7] "isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he"][[41 24 8] "was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full"][[41 24 9] "of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and"][[41 24 10] "scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable"][[41 24 11] "idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart"][[41 24 12] "his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes."][[41 24 13] "Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,"][[41 24 14] "yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on"][[41 24 15] "his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,"][[41 24 16] "that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in"][[41 24 17] "him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only"][[41 24 18] "and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.

They were bent on profitable cruises, the"][[41 24 22] "profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an"][[41 24 23] "audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge."][[41 25 1] "Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a"][[41 25 2] "Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made"][[41 25 3] "up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--morally enfeebled"][[41 25 4] "also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in"][[41 25 5] "Starbuck, the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in"][[41 25 6] "Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask.

At intervals, it arched forth"][[42 12 6] "its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous"][[42 12 7] "flutterings and throbbings shook it.

Through its"][[42 12 9] "inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took"][[42 12 10] "hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white"][[42 12 11] "thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled"][[42 12 12] "waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of"][[42 12 13] "towns.

The flashing cascade of his"][[42 16 9] "mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more"][[42 16 10] "resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A"][[42 16 11] "most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western"][[42 16 12] "world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the"][[42 16 13] "glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,"][[42 16 14] "bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.

Nor"][[42 16 21] "can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble"][[42 16 22] "horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him"][[42 16 23] "with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though"][[42 16 24] "commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror."][[42 17 1] "But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that"][[42 17 2] "accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and"][[42 17 3] "Albatross."][[42 18 1] "What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks"][[42 18 2] "the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin!

But not so did it"][[44 5 4] "seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby"][[44 5 5] "calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and, also, calling"][[44 5 6] "to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular"][[44 5 7] "latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to"][[44 5 8] "certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground"][[44 5 9] "in search of his prey."][[44 6 1] "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the"][[44 6 2] "sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that,"][[44 6 3] "could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the"][[44 6 4] "logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated,"][[44 6 5] "then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in"][[44 6 6] "invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows."][[44 6 7] "On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory"][[44 6 8] "charts of the sperm whale.*"][[44 7 1] "*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne"][[44 7 2] "out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of"][[44 7 3] "the National Observatory, Washington, April th, . By"][[44 7 4] "that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in"][[44 7 5] "course of completion; and portions of it are presented in"][[44 7 6] "the circular. \"This chart divides the ocean into districts"][[44 7 7] "of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;"][[44 7 8] "perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve"][[44 7 9] "columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each"][[44 7 10] "of which districts are three lines; one to show the number"][[44 7 11] "of days that have been spent in each month in every"][[44 7 12] "district, and the two others to show the number of days in"][[44 7 13] "which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\""][[44 8 1] "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the"][[44 8 2] "sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather, secret"][[44 8 3] "intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are called;"][[44 8 4] "continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating"][[44 8 5] "exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with"][[44 8 6] "one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the"][[44 8 7] "direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel,"][[44 8 8] "and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own"][[44 8 9] "unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these"][[44 8 10] "times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width"][[44 8 11] "(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but"][[44 8 12] "never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads,"][[44 8 13] "when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at"][[44 8 14] "particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating"][[44 8 15] "whales may with great confidence be looked for."][[44 9 1] "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate"][[44 9 2] "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing"][[44 9 3] "the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his"][[44 9 4] "art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly"][[44 9 5] "without prospect of a meeting."][[44 10 1] "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his"][[44 10 2] "delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,"][[44 10 3] "perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons"][[44 10 4] "for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the"][[44 10 5] "herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,"][[44 10 6] "say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found"][[44 10 7] "there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable"][[44 10 8] "instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the"][[44 10 9] "same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries"][[44 10 10] "and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby"][[44 10 11] "Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the"][[44 10 12] "Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese"][[44 10 13] "Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of"][[44 10 14] "those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly"][[44 10 15] "encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where"][[44 10 16] "he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual"][[44 10 17] "stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged"][[44 10 18] "abode. And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have"][[44 10 19] "hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever"][[44 10 20] "way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular"][[44 10 21] "set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become"][[44 10 22] "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next"][[44 10 23] "thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined"][[44 10 24] "in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then,"][[44 10 25] "for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried,"][[44 10 26] "lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round,"][[44 10 27] "loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There"][[44 10 28] "it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had"][[44 10 29] "taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was"][[44 10 30] "that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive"][[44 10 31] "to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering"][[44 10 32] "vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering"][[44 10 33] "hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one"][[44 10 34] "crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those"][[44 10 35] "hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his"][[44 10 36] "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest."][[44 11 1] "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the"][[44 11 2] "Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander"][[44 11 3] "to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running"][[44 11 4] "down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time"][[44 11 5] "to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season."][[44 11 6] "Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been"][[44 11 7] "correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of"][[44 11 8] "things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days"][[44 11 9] "and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently"][[44 11 10] "enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance"][[44 11 11] "the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his"][[44 11 12] "periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the"][[44 11 13] "Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other"][[44 11 14] "waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers,"][[44 11 15] "Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might"][[44 11 16] "blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's"][[44 11 17] "circumnavigating wake."][[44 12 1] "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not"][[44 12 2] "but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary"][[44 12 3] "whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual"][[44 12 4] "recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the"][[44 12 5] "thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar"][[44 12 6] "snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but"][[44 12 7] "be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter"][[44 12 8] "to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he"][[44 12 9] "would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?"][[44 12 10] "His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear! And"][[44 12 11] "here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness"][[44 12 12] "and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the"][[44 12 13] "deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances"][[44 12 14] "of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved"][[44 12 15] "revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own"][[44 12 16] "bloody nails in his palms."][[44 13 1] "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid"][[44 13 2] "dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through"][[44 13 3] "the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them"][[44 13 4] "round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing"][[44 13 5] "of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes"][[44 13 6] "the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its"][[44 13 7] "base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and"][[44 13 8] "lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among"][[44 13 9] "them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be"][[44 13 10] "heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his"][[44 13 11] "state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,"][[44 13 12] "perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent"][[44 13 13] "weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens"][[44 13 14] "of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,"][[44 13 15] "unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had"][[44 13 16] "gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from"][[44 13 17] "it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or"][[44 13 18] "soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the"][[44 13 19] "characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer"][[44 13 20] "vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching"][[44 13 21] "contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no"][[44 13 22] "longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with"][[44 13 23] "the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up"][[44 13 24] "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,"][[44 13 25] "by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and"][[44 13 26] "devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay,"][[44 13 27] "could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was"][[44 13 28] "conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth."][[44 13 29] "Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when"][[44 13 30] "what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated"][[44 13 31] "thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be"][[44 13 32] "sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness in"][[44 13 33] "itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature"][[44 13 34] "in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a"][[44 13 35] "vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature"][[44 13 36] "he creates."][[45 0 0] "CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit."][[45 2 1] "So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as"][[45 2 2] "indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars"][[45 2 3] "in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier"][[45 2 4] "part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the"][[45 2 5] "leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly"][[45 2 6] "enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to"][[45 2 7] "take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire"][[45 2 8] "subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main"][[45 2 9] "points of this affair."][[45 3 1] "I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall"][[45 3 2] "be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of"][[45 3 3] "items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these"][[45 3 4] "citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of"][[45 3 5] "itself."][[45 4 1] "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after"][[45 4 2] "receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an"][[45 4 3] "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by"][[45 4 4] "the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same"][[45 4 5] "private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where"][[45 4 6] "three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I"][[45 4 7] "think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted"][[45 4 8] "them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to"][[45 4 9] "Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far"][[45 4 10] "into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,"][[45 4 11] "often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,"][[45 4 12] "with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of"][[45 4 13] "unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have"][[45 4 14] "been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,"][[45 4 15] "brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose."][[45 4 16] "This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the"][[45 4 17] "other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that"][[45 4 18] "is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,"][[45 4 19] "saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards"][[45 4 20] "taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out"][[45 4 21] "that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time"][[45 4 22] "distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's"][[45 4 23] "eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,"][[45 4 24] "but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,"][[45 4 25] "then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many"][[45 4 26] "other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no"][[45 4 27] "good ground to impeach."][[45 5 1] "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant"][[45 5 2] "the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable"][[45 5 3] "historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at"][[45 5 4] "distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became"][[45 5 5] "thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily"][[45 5 6] "peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar"][[45 5 7] "in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his"][[45 5 8] "peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly"][[45 5 9] "valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences"][[45 5 10] "of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about"][[45 5 11] "such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that"][[45 5 12] "most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their"][[45 5 13] "tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,"][[45 5 14] "without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some"][[45 5 15] "poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they"][[45 5 16] "make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they"][[45 5 17] "pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for"][[45 5 18] "their presumption."][[45 6 1] "But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual"][[45 6 2] "celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he"][[45 6 3] "famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,"][[45 6 4] "but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of"][[45 6 5] "a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was it not so,"][[45 6 6] "O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long"][[45 6 7] "did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft"][[45 6 8] "seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack!"][[45 6 9] "thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of"][[45 6 10] "the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty"][[45 6 11] "jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross"][[45 6 12] "against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked"][[45 6 13] "like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain"][[45 6 14] "prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean"][[45 6 15] "History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar."][[45 7 1] "But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various"][[45 7 2] "times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were"][[45 7 3] "finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed"][[45 7 4] "by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with"][[45 7 5] "that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the"][[45 7 6] "Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture"][[45 7 7] "that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the"][[45 7 8] "Indian King Philip."][[45 8 1] "I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make"][[45 8 2] "mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in"][[45 8 3] "printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the"][[45 8 4] "whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For"][[45 8 5] "this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full"][[45 8 6] "as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of"][[45 8 7] "the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without"][[45 8 8] "some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the"][[45 8 9] "fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still"][[45 8 10] "worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory."][[45 9 1] "First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general"][[45 9 2] "perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid"][[45 9 3] "conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur."][[45 9 4] "One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and"][[45 9 5] "deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,"][[45 9 6] "however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose"][[45 9 7] "that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the"][[45 9 8] "whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the"][[45 9 9] "bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan--do you suppose that that"][[45 9 10] "poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read"][[45 9 11] "to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular"][[45 9 12] "between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be"][[45 9 13] "called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you"][[45 9 14] "that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many"][[45 9 15] "others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a"][[45 9 16] "death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each"][[45 9 17] "lost a boat's crew. For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and"][[45 9 18] "candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was"][[45 9 19] "spilled for it."][[45 10 1] "Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is"][[45 10 2] "an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when"][[45 10 3] "narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,"][[45 10 4] "they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I"][[45 10 5] "declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,"][[45 10 6] "when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt."][[45 11 1] "But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon"][[45 11 2] "testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm"][[45 11 3] "Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously"][[45 11 4] "malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and"][[45 11 5] "sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it."][[45 12 1] "First: In the year  the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,"][[45 12 2] "was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her"][[45 12 3] "boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of"][[45 12 4] "the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping"][[45 12 5] "from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the"][[45 12 6] "ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in"][[45 12 7] "less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving"][[45 12 8] "plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of"][[45 12 9] "the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,"][[45 12 10] "Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another"][[45 12 11] "ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and"][[45 12 12] "breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith"][[45 12 13] "forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain"][[45 12 14] "Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.

His"][[45 14 8] "aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He"][[45 14 9] "came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in"][[45 14 10] "which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge"][[45 14 11] "for their sufferings.\" Again: \"At all events, the whole circumstances"][[45 14 12] "taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the"][[45 14 13] "time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the"][[45 14 14] "part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall),"][[45 14 15] "induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.\""][[45 15 1] "Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during"][[45 15 2] "a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any"][[45 15 3] "hospitable shore. \"The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the"][[45 15 4] "fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed"][[45 15 5] "upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful"][[45 15 6] "contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the"][[45 15 7] "dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,"][[45 15 8] "wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.\""][[45 16 1] "In another place--p. ,--he speaks of \"THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK"][[45 16 2] "OF THE ANIMAL.\""][[45 18 1] "Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year"][[45 18 2] "totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic"][[45 18 3] "particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,"][[45 18 4] "though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions"][[45 18 5] "to it."][[45 19 1] "Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then"][[45 19 2] "commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be"][[45 19 3] "dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in"][[45 19 4] "the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,"][[45 19 5] "the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength"][[45 19 6] "ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily"][[45 19 7] "denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war"][[45 19 8] "as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there"][[45 19 9] "is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this"][[45 19 10] "impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a"][[45 19 11] "portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business"][[45 19 12] "with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such"][[45 19 13] "a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest"][[45 19 14] "port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider"][[45 19 15] "the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul"][[45 19 16] "of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the"][[45 19 17] "sperm whale will stand no nonsense."][[45 20 1] "I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little circumstance"][[45 20 2] "in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you"][[45 20 3] "must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern's"][[45 20 4] "famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century."][[45 20 5] "Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:"][[45 21 1] "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day"][[45 21 2] "we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very"][[45 21 3] "clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on"][[45 21 4] "our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not"][[45 21 5] "till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An"][[45 21 6] "uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,"][[45 21 7] "lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any"][[45 21 8] "one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,"][[45 21 9] "was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking"][[45 21 10] "against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this"][[45 21 11] "gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at"][[45 21 12] "least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,"][[45 21 13] "while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding"][[45 21 14] "that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster"][[45 21 15] "sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf"][[45 21 16] "applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel"][[45 21 17] "had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily"][[45 21 18] "it had escaped entirely uninjured.\""][[45 22 1] "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in"][[45 22 2] "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual"][[45 22 3] "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of"][[45 22 4] "Dorchester near Boston. I have the honour of being a nephew of his. I"][[45 22 5] "have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff."][[45 22 6] "He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large"][[45 22 7] "one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my"][[45 22 8] "uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home."][[45 23 1] "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,"][[45 23 2] "of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier's"][[45 23 3] "old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted"][[45 23 4] "from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a"][[45 23 5] "corroborative example, if such be needed."][[45 24 1] "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls"][[45 24 2] "the modern Juan Fernandes. \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about four"][[45 24 3] "o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues"][[45 24 4] "from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our"][[45 24 5] "men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were"][[45 24 6] "or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed,"][[45 24 7] "the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the"][[45 24 8] "ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little"][[45 24 9] "over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The"][[45 24 10] "suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and"][[45 24 11] "several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who"][[45 24 12] "lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\" Lionel then"][[45 24 13] "goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate"][[45 24 14] "the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about"][[45 24 15] "that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But"][[45 24 16] "I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the"][[45 24 17] "morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically"][[45 24 18] "bumping the hull from beneath."][[45 25 1] "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to"][[45 25 2] "me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more"][[45 25 3] "than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing"][[45 25 4] "boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long"][[45 25 5] "withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship"][[45 25 6] "Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength,"][[45 25 7] "let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a"][[45 25 8] "running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and"][[45 25 9] "secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a"][[45 25 10] "horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if"][[45 25 11] "the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,"][[45 25 12] "not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of"][[45 25 13] "destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent"][[45 25 14] "indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently"][[45 25 15] "open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several"][[45 25 16] "consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a"][[45 25 17] "concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which"][[45 25 18] "you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in"][[45 25 19] "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these"][[45 25 20] "marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for"][[45 25 21] "the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is nothing new"][[45 25 22] "under the sun."][[45 26 1] "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate"][[45 26 2] "of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius"][[45 26 3] "general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work"][[45 26 4] "every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been"][[45 26 5] "considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in"][[45 26 6] "some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently"][[45 26 7] "to be mentioned."][[45 27 1] "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term"][[45 27 2] "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured"][[45 27 3] "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed"][[45 27 4] "vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty"][[45 27 5] "years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be"][[45 27 6] "gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species"][[45 27 7] "this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as"][[45 27 8] "well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly"][[45 27 9] "inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long"][[45 27 10] "time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the"][[45 27 11] "Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am"][[45 27 12] "certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the"][[45 27 13] "present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious"][[45 27 14] "resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in"][[45 27 15] "modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the"][[45 27 16] "sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that"][[45 27 17] "on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found"][[45 27 18] "the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes"][[45 27 19] "through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,"][[45 27 20] "pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis."][[45 28 1] "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance"][[45 28 2] "called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have"][[45 28 3] "every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--squid or"][[45 28 4] "cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,"][[45 28 5] "but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its"][[45 28 6] "surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and"][[45 28 7] "reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all"][[45 28 8] "human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove"][[45 28 9] "the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm"][[45 28 10] "whale."][[46 0 0] "CHAPTER 46. Surmises."][[46 2 1] "Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his"][[46 2 2] "thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;"][[46 2 3] "though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one"][[46 2 4] "passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long"][[46 2 5] "habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether to"][[46 2 6] "abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if"][[46 2 7] "this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more"][[46 2 8] "influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even"][[46 2 9] "considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the"][[46 2 10] "White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all"][[46 2 11] "sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he"][[46 2 12] "multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would"][[46 2 13] "prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed"][[46 2 14] "exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though"][[46 2 15] "not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet"][[46 2 16] "were by no means incapable of swaying him."][[46 3 1] "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in"][[46 3 2] "the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,"][[46 3 3] "for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was"][[46 3 4] "over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual"][[46 3 5] "man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual"][[46 3 6] "mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a"][[46 3 7] "sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck's body and Starbuck's coerced will"][[46 3 8] "were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still"][[46 3 9] "he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his"][[46 3 10] "captain's quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from"][[46 3 11] "it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse"][[46 3 12] "ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck"][[46 3 13] "would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his"][[46 3 14] "captain's leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial"][[46 3 15] "influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle"][[46 3 16] "insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly"][[46 3 17] "manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing"][[46 3 18] "that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that"][[46 3 19] "strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that"][[46 3 20] "the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure"][[46 3 21] "background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation"][[46 3 22] "unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches,"][[46 3 23] "his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby"][[46 3 24] "Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the"][[46 3 25] "announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less"][[46 3 26] "capricious and unreliable--they live in the varying outer weather, and"][[46 3 27] "they inhale its fickleness--and when retained for any object remote and"][[46 3 28] "blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the"][[46 3 29] "end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and"][[46 3 30] "employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the"][[46 3 31] "final dash."][[46 4 1] "Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion"][[46 4 2] "mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent."][[46 4 3] "The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought"][[46 4 4] "Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the"][[46 4 5] "hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even"][[46 4 6] "breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the"][[46 4 7] "love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food"][[46 4 8] "for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and"][[46 4 9] "chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two"][[46 4 10] "thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without"][[46 4 11] "committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious"][[46 4 12] "perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final"][[46 4 13] "and romantic object--that final and romantic object, too many would have"][[46 4 14] "turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all"][[46 4 15] "hopes of cash--aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months"][[46 4 16] "go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same"][[46 4 17] "quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon"][[46 4 18] "cashier Ahab."][[46 5 1] "Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related"][[46 5 2] "to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps"][[46 5 3] "somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the"][[46 5 4] "Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,"][[46 5 5] "he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of"][[46 5 6] "usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew"][[46 5 7] "if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further"][[46 5 8] "obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From"][[46 5 9] "even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible"][[46 5 10] "consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must"][[46 5 11] "of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection"][[46 5 12] "could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,"][[46 5 13] "backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute"][[46 5 14] "atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected"][[46 5 15] "to."][[46 6 1] "For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be"][[46 6 2] "verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good"][[46 6 3] "degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's"][[46 6 4] "voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force"][[46 6 5] "himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general"][[46 6 6] "pursuit of his profession."][[46 7 1] "Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three"][[46 7 2] "mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit"][[46 7 3] "reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward."][[47 0 0] "CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker."][[47 2 1] "It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging"][[47 2 2] "about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters."][[47 2 3] "Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,"][[47 2 4] "for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet"][[47 2 5] "somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie"][[47 2 6] "lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own"][[47 2 7] "invisible self."][[47 3 1] "I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I"][[47 3 2] "kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between"][[47 3 3] "the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as"][[47 3 4] "Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword"][[47 3 5] "between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and"][[47 3 6] "unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did"][[47 3 7] "there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by"][[47 3 8] "the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were"][[47 3 9] "the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving"][[47 3 10] "and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp"][[47 3 11] "subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and"][[47 3 12] "that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending"][[47 3 13] "of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here,"][[47 3 14] "thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own"][[47 3 15] "destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive,"][[47 3 16] "indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly,"][[47 3 17] "or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference"][[47 3 18] "in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final"][[47 3 19] "aspect of the completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I,"][[47 3 20] "which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this"][[47 3 21] "easy, indifferent sword must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and"][[47 3 22] "necessity--nowise incompatible--all interweavingly working together."][[47 3 23] "The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate"][[47 3 24] "course--its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;"][[47 3 25] "free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and"][[47 3 26] "chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of"][[47 3 27] "necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though"][[47 3 28] "thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the"][[47 3 29] "last featuring blow at events."][[47 5 1] "Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so"][[47 5 2] "strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball"][[47 5 3] "of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds"][[47 5 4] "whence that voice dropped like a wing.

For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale"][[47 15 5] "when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while"][[47 15 6] "concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the"][[47 15 7] "opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action;"][[47 15 8] "for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had"][[47 15 9] "been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of"][[47 15 10] "the men selected for shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the"][[47 15 11] "boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The"][[47 15 12] "sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed"][[47 15 13] "in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed,"][[47 15 14] "and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over"][[47 15 15] "high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand"][[47 15 16] "clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale."][[47 15 17] "So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on"][[47 15 18] "board an enemy's ship."][[47 16 1] "But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took"][[47 16 2] "every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was"][[47 16 3] "surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air."][[48 0 0] "CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering."][[48 2 1] "The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side"][[48 2 2] "of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the"][[48 2 3] "tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always"][[48 2 4] "been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the"][[48 2 5] "captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The"][[48 2 6] "figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white"][[48 2 7] "tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese"][[48 2 8] "jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers"][[48 2 9] "of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a"][[48 2 10] "glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled"][[48 2 11] "round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of"][[48 2 12] "this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to"][[48 2 13] "some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;--a race notorious for"][[48 2 14] "a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners"][[48 2 15] "supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the"][[48 2 16] "water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be"][[48 2 17] "elsewhere."][[48 3 1] "While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers,"][[48 3 2] "Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, \"All ready"][[48 3 3] "there, Fedallah?\""][[48 4 1] "\"Ready,\" was the half-hissed reply."][[48 5 1] "\"Lower away then; d'ye hear?\" shouting across the deck. \"Lower away"][[48 5 2] "there, I say.\""][[48 6 1] "Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men"][[48 6 2] "sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a"][[48 6 3] "wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,"][[48 6 4] "off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,"][[48 6 5] "goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats"][[48 6 6] "below."][[48 7 1] "Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth"][[48 7 2] "keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and"][[48 7 3] "showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern,"][[48 7 4] "loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely,"][[48 7 5] "so as to cover a large expanse of water.

Start her, marling-spikes!\""][[48 14 1] "Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had"][[48 14 2] "rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in"][[48 14 3] "inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this"][[48 14 4] "specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions"][[48 14 5] "with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief"][[48 14 6] "peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a"][[48 14 7] "tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so"][[48 14 8] "calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such"][[48 14 9] "queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for"][[48 14 10] "the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and"][[48 14 11] "indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly"][[48 14 12] "gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning"][[48 14 13] "commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew."][[48 14 14] "Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity"][[48 14 15] "is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their"][[48 14 16] "guard in the matter of obeying them."][[48 15 1] "In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely"][[48 15 2] "across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were"][[48 15 3] "pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate."][[48 16 1] "\"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye"][[48 16 2] "please!\""][[48 17 1] "\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he"][[48 17 2] "spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set"][[48 17 3] "like a flint from Stubb's."][[48 18 1] "\"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!"][[48 19 1] "\"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed.

Give way!\""][[48 21 1] "Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant"][[48 21 2] "as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably"][[48 21 3] "awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's"][[48 21 4] "company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got"][[48 21 5] "abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some"][[48 21 6] "small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge"][[48 21 7] "of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb's confident way"][[48 21 8] "of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from"][[48 21 9] "superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for"][[48 21 10] "all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab's precise agency in the"][[48 21 11] "matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious"][[48 21 12] "shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket"][[48 21 13] "dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah."][[48 22 1] "Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the"][[48 22 2] "furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a"][[48 22 3] "circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger"][[48 22 4] "yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five"][[48 22 5] "trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which"][[48 22 6] "periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst"][[48 22 7] "boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen"][[48 22 8] "pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and"][[48 22 9] "displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the"][[48 22 10] "gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery"][[48 22 11] "horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a"][[48 22 12] "fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any"][[48 22 13] "tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in"][[48 22 14] "a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once"][[48 22 15] "the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,"][[48 22 16] "while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and"][[48 22 17] "crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the"][[48 22 18] "rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily"][[48 22 19] "down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the"][[48 22 20] "movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it."][[48 23 1] "\"Every man look out along his oars!\" cried Starbuck. \"Thou, Queequeg,"][[48 23 2] "stand up!\""][[48 24 1] "Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage"][[48 24 2] "stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the"][[48 24 3] "spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme"][[48 24 4] "stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with"][[48 24 5] "the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing"][[48 24 6] "himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently"][[48 24 7] "eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea."][[48 25 1] "Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still; its"][[48 25 2] "commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout"][[48 25 3] "sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the"][[48 25 4] "level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the"][[48 25 5] "whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand,"][[48 25 6] "and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the"][[48 25 7] "mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks.

And here was"][[48 30 6] "Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a"][[48 30 7] "breastband to lean against and steady himself by."][[48 31 1] "At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous"][[48 31 2] "habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect"][[48 31 3] "posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously"][[48 31 4] "perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily"][[48 31 5] "perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the"][[48 31 6] "sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;"][[48 31 7] "for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,"][[48 31 8] "barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously"][[48 31 9] "rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed"][[48 31 10] "a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly"][[48 31 11] "vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then"][[48 31 12] "stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to"][[48 31 13] "the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the"][[48 31 14] "living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her"][[48 31 15] "seasons for that."][[48 32 1] "Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing"][[48 32 2] "solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,"][[48 32 3] "not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,"][[48 32 4] "Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the"][[48 32 5] "languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,"][[48 32 6] "where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed"][[48 32 7] "home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match"][[48 32 8] "across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer,"][[48 32 9] "whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly"][[48 32 10] "dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a"][[48 32 11] "quick phrensy of hurry, \"Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!\""][[48 33 1] "To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been"][[48 33 2] "visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white"][[48 33 3] "water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and"][[48 33 4] "suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white"][[48 33 5] "rolling billows.

For a time, there"][[51 6 7] "reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition,"][[51 6 8] "as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the"][[51 6 9] "monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest"][[51 6 10] "and most savage seas."][[51 7 1] "These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous"][[51 7 2] "potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath"][[51 7 3] "all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as"][[51 7 4] "for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely"][[51 7 5] "mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed"][[51 7 6] "vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow."][[51 8 1] "But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling"][[51 8 2] "around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are"][[51 8 3] "there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and"][[51 8 4] "gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips,"][[51 8 5] "the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity"][[51 8 6] "of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before."][[51 9 1] "Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither"][[51 9 2] "before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And"][[51 9 3] "every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and"][[51 9 4] "spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,"][[51 9 5] "as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing"][[51 9 6] "appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their"][[51 9 7] "homeless selves.

Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called"][[51 10 2] "of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had"][[51 10 3] "attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea,"][[51 10 4] "where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed"][[51 10 5] "condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat"][[51 10 6] "that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying;"][[51 10 7] "still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us"][[51 10 8] "on from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried."][[51 11 1] "During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the"][[51 11 2] "time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,"][[51 11 3] "manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed"][[51 11 4] "his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and"][[51 11 5] "aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await"][[51 11 6] "the issue of the gale.

Meantime, the crew"][[51 11 11] "driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that"][[51 11 12] "burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in"][[51 11 13] "the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man"][[51 11 14] "had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which"][[51 11 15] "he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the"][[51 11 16] "silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore"][[51 11 17] "on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves."][[51 11 18] "By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the"][[51 11 19] "ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still"][[51 11 20] "wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed"][[51 11 21] "demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never"][[51 11 22] "could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night going down"][[51 11 23] "into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with"][[51 11 24] "closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain"][[51 11 25] "and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before"][[51 11 26] "emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the"][[51 11 27] "table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents"][[51 11 28] "which have previously been spoken of.

As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the"][[52 2 4] "fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro"][[52 2 5] "in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent from home."][[52 3 1] "As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the"][[52 3 2] "skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral"][[52 3 3] "appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her"][[52 3 4] "spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over"][[52 3 5] "with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to"][[52 3 6] "see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed"][[52 3 7] "clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had"][[52 3 8] "survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to"][[52 3 9] "the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when"][[52 3 10] "the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air"][[52 3 11] "came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the"][[52 3 12] "mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking"][[52 3 13] "fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own"][[52 3 14] "look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below."][[52 4 1] "\"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\""][[52 5 1] "But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the"][[52 5 2] "act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand"][[52 5 3] "into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make"][[52 5 4] "himself heard without it.

But taking"][[52 5 10] "advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and"][[52 5 11] "knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and"][[52 5 12] "shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--\"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod,"][[52 5 13] "bound round the world!

But"][[52 7 4] "turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the"][[52 7 5] "wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,--\"Up"][[52 7 6] "helm!

The Gam."][[53 2 1] "The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had"][[53 2 2] "spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had"][[53 2 3] "this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded"][[53 2 4] "her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it"][[53 2 5] "had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative"][[53 2 6] "answer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he"][[53 2 7] "cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,"][[53 2 8] "except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly"][[53 2 9] "sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not"][[53 2 10] "something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when"][[53 2 11] "meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common"][[53 2 12] "cruising-ground."][[53 3 1] "If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the"][[53 3 2] "equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering"][[53 3 3] "each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of"][[53 3 4] "them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment"][[53 3 5] "to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while"][[53 3 6] "and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the"][[53 3 7] "illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling"][[53 3 8] "vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off lone"][[53 3 9] "Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more natural,"][[53 3 10] "I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only"][[53 3 11] "interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and"][[53 3 12] "sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of"][[53 3 13] "course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,"][[53 3 14] "officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other;"][[53 3 15] "and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about."][[53 4 1] "For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on"][[53 4 2] "board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a"][[53 4 3] "date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn"][[53 4 4] "files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would"][[53 4 5] "receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to"][[53 4 6] "which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And"][[53 4 7] "in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing"][[53 4 8] "each other's track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they"][[53 4 9] "are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received a"][[53 4 10] "transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and"][[53 4 11] "some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets."][[53 4 12] "Besides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable"][[53 4 13] "chat. For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,"][[53 4 14] "but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common"][[53 4 15] "pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils."][[53 5 1] "Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;"][[53 5 2] "that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case"][[53 5 3] "with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of"][[53 5 4] "English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they"][[53 5 5] "do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your"][[53 5 6] "Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that"][[53 5 7] "sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers"][[53 5 8] "sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American"][[53 5 9] "whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript"][[53 5 10] "provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority"][[53 5 11] "in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,"][[53 5 12] "seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than"][[53 5 13] "all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless"][[53 5 14] "little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does"][[53 5 15] "not take much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few"][[53 5 16] "foibles himself."][[53 6 1] "So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the"][[53 6 2] "whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so. Whereas, some"][[53 6 3] "merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will"][[53 6 4] "oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,"][[53 6 5] "mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in"][[53 6 6] "Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon"][[53 6 7] "each other's rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea,"][[53 6 8] "they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such"][[53 6 9] "a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down"][[53 6 10] "hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching"][[53 6 11] "Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run"][[53 6 12] "away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they"][[53 6 13] "chance to cross each other's cross-bones, the first hail is--\"How many"][[53 6 14] "skulls?\"--the same way that whalers hail--\"How many barrels?\" And that"][[53 6 15] "question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are"][[53 6 16] "infernal villains on both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each"][[53 6 17] "other's villanous likenesses."][[53 7 1] "But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,"][[53 7 2] "free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another"][[53 7 3] "whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \"GAM,\" a thing so"][[53 7 4] "utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name"][[53 7 5] "even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and"][[53 7 6] "repeat gamesome stuff about \"spouters\" and \"blubber-boilers,\" and such"][[53 7 7] "like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also"][[53 7 8] "all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such"][[53 7 9] "a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be"][[53 7 10] "hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to"][[53 7 11] "know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about"][[53 7 12] "it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the"][[53 7 13] "gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has"][[53 7 14] "no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude,"][[53 7 15] "that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that"][[53 7 16] "assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on."][[53 8 1] "But what is a GAM? You might wear out your index-finger running up and"][[53 8 2] "down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.

All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so"][[53 10 3] "has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when"][[53 10 4] "the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern"][[53 10 5] "sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often"][[53 10 6] "steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with"][[53 10 7] "gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of"][[53 10 8] "that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling"][[53 10 9] "captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen"][[53 10 10] "in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of"][[53 10 11] "any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew"][[53 10 12] "must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of"][[53 10 13] "the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and"][[53 10 14] "the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit"][[53 10 15] "all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being"][[53 10 16] "conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from"][[53 10 17] "the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the"][[53 10 18] "importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is"][[53 10 19] "this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting"][[53 10 20] "steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the"][[53 10 21] "after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus"][[53 10 22] "completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself"][[53 10 23] "sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent"][[53 10 24] "pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of"][[53 10 25] "foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a"][[53 10 26] "spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,"][[53 10 27] "it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would"][[53 10 28] "never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying"][[53 10 29] "himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with"][[53 10 30] "his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he"][[53 10 31] "generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being"][[53 10 32] "generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast."][[53 10 33] "Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too,"][[53 10 34] "where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or"][[53 10 35] "two, in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's"][[53 10 36] "hair, and hold on there like grim death."][[54 0 0] "CHAPTER 54.

Interweaving in its proper"][[54 5 22] "place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the"][[54 5 23] "ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting"][[54 5 24] "record."][[54 7 1] "*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,"][[54 7 2] "still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin."][[54 9 1] "For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated"][[54 9 2] "it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve,"][[54 9 3] "smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those"][[54 9 4] "fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer"][[54 9 5] "terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally"][[54 9 6] "put, and which are duly answered at the time."][[54 10 1] "\"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about"][[54 10 2] "rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,"][[54 10 3] "was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward"][[54 10 4] "from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the"][[54 10 5] "northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to"][[54 10 6] "daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than"][[54 10 7] "common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the"][[54 10 8] "captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck"][[54 10 9] "awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit"][[54 10 10] "them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,"][[54 10 11] "indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down"][[54 10 12] "as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her"][[54 10 13] "cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals;"][[54 10 14] "but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet"][[54 10 15] "undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking"][[54 10 16] "some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest"][[54 10 17] "harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired."][[54 11 1] "\"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance"][[54 11 2] "favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,"][[54 11 3] "because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at"][[54 11 4] "them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;"][[54 11 5] "never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the"][[54 11 6] "whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the"][[54 11 7] "Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port"][[54 11 8] "without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the"][[54 11 9] "brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly"][[54 11 10] "provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo."][[54 12 1] "\"'Lakeman!--Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'"][[54 12 2] "said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass."][[54 13 1] "\"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your"][[54 13 2] "courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.

For in their interflowing aggregate,"][[54 13 8] "those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and"][[54 13 9] "Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many"][[54 13 10] "of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of"][[54 13 11] "races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,"][[54 13 12] "even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great"][[54 13 13] "contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime"][[54 13 14] "approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted"][[54 13 15] "all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries,"][[54 13 16] "and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the"][[54 13 17] "fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their"][[54 13 18] "beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out"][[54 13 19] "their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient"][[54 13 20] "and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines"][[54 13 21] "of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric"][[54 13 22] "beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes"][[54 13 23] "to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and"][[54 13 24] "Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the"][[54 13 25] "full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,"][[54 13 26] "and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as"][[54 13 27] "direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are,"][[54 13 28] "for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many"][[54 13 29] "a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though"][[54 13 30] "an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;"][[54 13 31] "as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his"][[54 13 32] "infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse"][[54 13 33] "at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our"][[54 13 34] "austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as"][[54 13 35] "vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh"][[54 13 36] "from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this"][[54 13 37] "Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a"][[54 13 38] "mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible"][[54 13 39] "firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition"][[54 13 40] "which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had"][[54 13 41] "long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved"][[54 13 42] "so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,"][[54 13 43] "gentlemen, you shall hear."][[54 14 1] "\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing"][[54 14 2] "her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again"][[54 14 3] "increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps"][[54 14 4] "every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our"][[54 14 5] "Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole"][[54 14 6] "way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of"][[54 14 7] "the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability"][[54 14 8] "would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on"][[54 14 9] "account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the"][[54 14 10] "solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it"][[54 14 11] "altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in"][[54 14 12] "full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie"][[54 14 13] "along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat"][[54 14 14] "is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of"][[54 14 15] "the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her"][[54 14 16] "captain begins to feel a little anxious."][[54 15 1] "\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found"][[54 15 2] "gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by"][[54 15 3] "several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded"][[54 15 4] "the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way"][[54 15 5] "expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a"][[54 15 6] "coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness"][[54 15 7] "touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or"][[54 15 8] "on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when"][[54 15 9] "he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the"][[54 15 10] "seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in"][[54 15 11] "her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on"][[54 15 12] "this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood"][[54 15 13] "with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water;"][[54 15 14] "clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps"][[54 15 15] "ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee"][[54 15 16] "scupper-holes."][[54 16 1] "\"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional"][[54 16 2] "world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command"][[54 16 3] "over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his"][[54 16 4] "superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he"][[54 16 5] "conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a"][[54 16 6] "chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and"][[54 16 7] "make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,"][[54 16 8] "gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a"][[54 16 9] "head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings"][[54 16 10] "of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and"][[54 16 11] "a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he"][[54 16 12] "been born son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly"][[54 16 13] "as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love"][[54 16 14] "Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it."][[54 17 1] "\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the"][[54 17 2] "rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with"][[54 17 3] "his gay banterings."][[54 18 1] "\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one"][[54 18 2] "of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell"][[54 18 3] "ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away"][[54 18 4] "his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish"][[54 18 5] "only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,"][[54 18 6] "saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em"][[54 18 7] "are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making"][[54 18 8] "improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump"][[54 18 9] "overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I"][[54 18 10] "can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,"][[54 18 11] "they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I"][[54 18 12] "wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'"][[54 19 1] "\"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,"][[54 19 2] "pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'"][[54 20 1] "\"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys,"][[54 20 2] "lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;"][[54 20 3] "the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping"][[54 20 4] "of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's"][[54 20 5] "utmost energies."][[54 21 1] "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went"][[54 21 2] "forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face"][[54 21 3] "fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his"][[54 21 4] "brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney"][[54 21 5] "to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know"][[54 21 6] "not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate"][[54 21 7] "commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a"][[54 21 8] "shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig"][[54 21 9] "to run at large."][[54 22 1] "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household"][[54 22 2] "work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every"][[54 22 3] "evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually"][[54 22 4] "foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of"][[54 22 5] "sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom"][[54 22 6] "would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all"][[54 22 7] "vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,"][[54 22 8] "if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho"][[54 22 9] "that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being"][[54 22 10] "the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly"][[54 22 11] "assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have"][[54 22 12] "been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical"][[54 22 13] "duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these"][[54 22 14] "particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood"][[54 22 15] "between the two men."][[54 23 1] "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as"][[54 23 2] "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat"][[54 23 3] "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will"][[54 23 4] "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully"][[54 23 5] "comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for"][[54 23 6] "a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and"][[54 23 7] "perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match"][[54 23 8] "silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all"][[54 23 9] "this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper"][[54 23 10] "passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when"][[54 23 11] "felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless"][[54 23 12] "phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt."][[54 24 1] "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily"][[54 24 2] "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping"][[54 24 3] "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without"][[54 24 4] "at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary"][[54 24 5] "sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or"][[54 24 6] "nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most"][[54 24 7] "domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his"][[54 24 8] "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an"][[54 24 9] "uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by."][[54 25 1] "\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for"][[54 25 2] "all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt"][[54 25 3] "could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still"][[54 25 4] "smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained"][[54 25 5] "doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the"][[54 25 6] "hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do"][[54 25 7] "his bidding."][[54 26 1] "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily"][[54 26 2] "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his"][[54 26 3] "intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not"][[54 26 4] "the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his"][[54 26 5] "twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to"][[54 26 6] "no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;"][[54 26 7] "when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had"][[54 26 8] "now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on"][[54 26 9] "the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:"][[54 27 1] "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to"][[54 27 2] "yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where"][[54 27 3] "the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of"][[54 27 4] "his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions."][[54 27 5] "Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye"][[54 27 6] "with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching"][[54 27 7] "his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his"][[54 27 8] "persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would"][[54 27 9] "murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter"][[54 27 10] "by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant"][[54 27 11] "the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch"][[54 27 12] "spouting blood like a whale."][[54 28 1] "\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays"][[54 28 2] "leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their"][[54 28 3] "mastheads. They were both Canallers."][[54 29 1] "\"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro. 'We have seen many whale-ships in our"][[54 29 2] "harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.

But sliding down the"][[54 39 4] "ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and"][[54 39 5] "sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the"][[54 39 6] "sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued;"][[54 39 7] "while standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down"][[54 39 8] "with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious"][[54 39 9] "scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran"][[54 39 10] "close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into"][[54 39 11] "the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his"][[54 39 12] "resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them"][[54 39 13] "all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily"][[54 39 14] "slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,"][[54 39 15] "these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade."][[54 40 1] "\"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing them"][[54 40 2] "with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.

Fearing in his heart"][[54 41 5] "lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but"][[54 41 6] "still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty."][[54 42 1] "\"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their"][[54 42 2] "ringleader."][[54 43 1] "\"'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!

Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak;"][[54 70 6] "but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the"][[54 70 7] "captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his"][[54 70 8] "pinioned foe."][[54 71 1] "\"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman."][[54 72 1] "\"'So I am, but take that.'

On the contrary, it seemed,"][[54 73 7] "that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain"][[54 73 8] "the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the"][[54 73 9] "ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the"][[54 73 10] "speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing--namely,"][[54 73 11] "not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,"][[54 73 12] "spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still"][[54 73 13] "maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to"][[54 73 14] "lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the"][[54 73 15] "cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his"][[54 73 16] "berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the"][[54 73 17] "vital jaw of the whale."][[54 74 1] "\"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of"][[54 74 2] "passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all"][[54 74 3] "was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who"][[54 74 4] "had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief"][[54 74 5] "mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than"][[54 74 6] "half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,"][[54 74 7] "against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head"][[54 74 8] "of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances,"][[54 74 9] "Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge."][[54 75 1] "\"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the"][[54 75 2] "bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of"][[54 75 3] "the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side."][[54 75 4] "In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a"][[54 75 5] "considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between"][[54 75 6] "this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next"][[54 75 7] "trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the"][[54 75 8] "third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure,"][[54 75 9] "he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his"][[54 75 10] "watches below."][[54 76 1] "\"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate."][[54 77 1] "\"'What do you think? what does it look like?'"][[54 78 1] "\"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'"][[54 79 1] "\"'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length"][[54 79 2] "before him; 'but I think it will answer.

All was now a phrensy."][[54 91 7] "'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from captain, mates,"][[54 91 8] "and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious"][[54 91 9] "to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed"][[54 91 10] "askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,"][[54 91 11] "that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like"][[54 91 12] "a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality"][[54 91 13] "pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out"][[54 91 14] "before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the"][[54 91 15] "mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while"][[54 91 16] "Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken"][[54 91 17] "the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were"][[54 91 18] "lowered, the mate's got the start; and none howled more fiercely with"][[54 91 19] "delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff"][[54 91 20] "pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to"][[54 91 21] "the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his"][[54 91 22] "bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back. Nothing"][[54 91 23] "loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that"][[54 91 24] "blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as"][[54 91 25] "against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate."][[54 91 26] "That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,"][[54 91 27] "and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the"][[54 91 28] "sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray,"][[54 91 29] "and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to"][[54 91 30] "remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round"][[54 91 31] "in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing"][[54 91 32] "high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down."][[54 92 1] "\"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had"][[54 92 2] "slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly"][[54 92 3] "looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,"][[54 92 4] "downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He"][[54 92 5] "cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose"][[54 92 6] "again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the"][[54 92 7] "teeth that had destroyed him.

Before showing that"][[55 11 5] "picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary"][[55 11 6] "retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not"][[55 11 7] "a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of"][[55 11 8] "a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that"][[55 11 9] "picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor"][[55 11 10] "in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that"][[55 11 11] "is, from a Chinese drawing.

Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have"][[55 13 3] "been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a"][[55 13 4] "drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent"][[55 13 5] "the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars."][[55 13 6] "Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan"][[55 13 7] "has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,"][[55 13 8] "in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in"][[55 13 9] "unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,"][[55 13 10] "like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a"][[55 13 11] "thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the"][[55 13 12] "air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not"][[55 13 13] "to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young"][[55 13 14] "sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the"][[55 13 15] "case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such"][[55 13 16] "is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that"][[55 13 17] "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch."][[55 14 1] "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded"][[55 14 2] "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all."][[55 14 3] "For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that"][[55 14 4] "his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy"][[55 14 5] "Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of"][[55 14 6] "his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian"][[55 14 7] "old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics;"][[55 14 8] "yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's"][[55 14 9] "articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton"][[55 14 10] "of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded"][[55 14 11] "animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes"][[55 14 12] "it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some"][[55 14 13] "part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously"][[55 14 14] "displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to"][[55 14 15] "the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb.

But"][[55 14 17] "all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human"][[55 14 18] "fingers in an artificial covering. \"However recklessly the whale may"][[55 14 19] "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be truly"][[55 14 20] "said to handle us without mittens.\""][[55 15 1] "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs"][[55 15 2] "conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world"][[55 15 3] "which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit"][[55 15 4] "the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very"][[55 15 5] "considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding"][[55 15 6] "out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in"][[55 15 7] "which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is"][[55 15 8] "by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of"][[55 15 9] "being eternally stove and sunk by him.

Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True"][[56 0 1] "Pictures of Whaling Scenes."][[56 2 1] "In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly"][[56 2 2] "tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of"][[56 2 3] "them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,"][[56 2 4] "especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass"][[56 2 5] "that matter by."][[56 3 1] "I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;"][[56 3 2] "Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.

All Beale's"][[56 3 5] "drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the"][[56 3 6] "picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second"][[56 3 7] "chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no"][[56 3 8] "doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is"][[56 3 9] "admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm"][[56 3 10] "Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they"][[56 3 11] "are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though."][[56 4 1] "Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they"][[56 4 2] "are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has"][[56 4 3] "but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because"][[56 4 4] "it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive"][[56 4 5] "anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living"][[56 4 6] "hunters."][[56 5 1] "But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details"][[56 5 2] "not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to"][[56 5 3] "be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,"][[56 5 4] "and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent"][[56 5 5] "attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble"][[56 5 6] "Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath"][[56 5 7] "the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air"][[56 5 8] "upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of"][[56 5 9] "the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon"][[56 5 10] "the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single"][[56 5 11] "incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the"][[56 5 12] "incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if"][[56 5 13] "from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and"][[56 5 14] "true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden"][[56 5 15] "poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the"][[56 5 16] "swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions"][[56 5 17] "of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down"][[56 5 18] "upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details"][[56 5 19] "of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not"][[56 5 20] "draw so good a one."][[56 6 1] "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside"][[56 6 2] "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black"][[56 6 3] "weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian"][[56 6 4] "cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so"][[56 6 5] "abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave"][[56 6 6] "supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the"][[56 6 7] "small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the"][[56 6 8] "Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while"][[56 6 9] "the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of"][[56 6 10] "tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock"][[56 6 11] "in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean"][[56 6 12] "steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in"][[56 6 13] "admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the"][[56 6 14] "drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of"][[56 6 15] "a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily"][[56 6 16] "hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole."][[56 7 1] "Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he"][[56 7 2] "was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously"][[56 7 3] "tutored by some experienced whaleman.

At first"][[60 5 2] "sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment"][[60 5 3] "its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and"][[60 5 4] "twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal"][[60 5 5] "to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something"][[60 5 6] "over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally"][[60 5 7] "coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so"][[60 5 8] "as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or"][[60 5 9] "layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the \"heart,\""][[60 5 10] "or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least"][[60 5 11] "tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take"][[60 5 12] "somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used"][[60 5 13] "in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an"][[60 5 14] "entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then"][[60 5 15] "reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act"][[60 5 16] "of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists."][[60 6 1] "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line"][[60 6 2] "being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this;"][[60 6 3] "because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the"][[60 6 4] "boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly"][[60 6 5] "three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky"][[60 6 6] "freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for"][[60 6 7] "the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up"][[60 6 8] "a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated"][[60 6 9] "one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub,"][[60 6 10] "the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great"][[60 6 11] "wedding-cake to present to the whales."][[60 7 1] "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an"][[60 7 2] "eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the"][[60 7 3] "tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything."][[60 7 4] "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:"][[60 7 5] "In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a"][[60 7 6] "neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as"][[60 7 7] "to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the"][[60 7 8] "harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug"][[60 7 9] "of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the"][[60 7 10] "first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This"][[60 7 11] "arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the"][[60 7 12] "lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the"][[60 7 13] "whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking"][[60 7 14] "minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed"][[60 7 15] "boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of"][[60 7 16] "the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again."][[60 8 1] "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is"][[60 8 2] "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again"][[60 8 3] "carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon"][[60 8 4] "the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist"][[60 8 5] "in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at"][[60 8 6] "the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme"][[60 8 7] "pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a"][[60 8 8] "common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs"][[60 8 9] "in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat"][[60 8 10] "again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled"][[60 8 11] "upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a"][[60 8 12] "little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--the rope"][[60 8 13] "which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that"][[60 8 14] "connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious"][[60 8 15] "to detail."][[60 9 1] "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,"][[60 9 2] "twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the"][[60 9 3] "oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid"][[60 9 4] "eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest"][[60 9 5] "snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal"][[60 9 6] "woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,"][[60 9 7] "and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any"][[60 9 8] "unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible"][[60 9 9] "contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus"][[60 9 10] "circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones"][[60 9 11] "to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit--strange thing! what"][[60 9 12] "cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,"][[60 9 13] "and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you"][[60 9 14] "will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus"][[60 9 15] "hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before"][[60 9 16] "King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death,"][[60 9 17] "with a halter around every neck, as you may say."][[60 10 1] "Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for"][[60 10 2] "those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually"][[60 10 3] "chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the"][[60 10 4] "line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in"][[60 10 5] "the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings"][[60 10 6] "of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and"][[60 10 7] "wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the"][[60 10 8] "heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and"][[60 10 9] "you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;"][[60 10 10] "and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of"][[60 10 11] "volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run"][[60 10 12] "away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out."][[60 11 1] "Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and"][[60 11 2] "prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;"][[60 11 3] "for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and"][[60 11 4] "contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal"][[60 11 5] "powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the"][[60 11 6] "line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought"][[60 11 7] "into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of true terror than"][[60 11 8] "any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men"][[60 11 9] "live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their"][[60 11 10] "necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,"][[60 11 11] "that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life."][[60 11 12] "And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would"][[60 11 13] "not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before"][[60 11 14] "your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side."][[61 0 0] "CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale."][[61 2 1] "If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to"][[61 2 2] "Queequeg it was quite a different object."][[61 3 1] "\"When you see him 'quid,\" said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow"][[61 3 2] "of his hoisted boat, \"then you quick see him 'parm whale.\""][[61 4 1] "The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special"][[61 4 2] "to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep"][[61 4 3] "induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through"][[61 4 4] "which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;"][[61 4 5] "that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,"][[61 4 6] "and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the"][[61 4 7] "Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru."][[61 5 1] "It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders"][[61 5 2] "leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in"][[61 5 3] "what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that"][[61 5 4] "dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my"][[61 5 5] "body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long"][[61 5 6] "after the power which first moved it is withdrawn."][[61 6 1] "Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen"][[61 6 2] "at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last"][[61 6 3] "all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing"][[61 6 4] "that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman."][[61 6 5] "The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance"][[61 6 6] "of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all."][[61 7 1] "Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my"][[61 7 2] "hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;"][[61 7 3] "with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty"][[61 7 4] "fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the"][[61 7 5] "capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,"][[61 7 6] "glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in"][[61 7 7] "the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury"][[61 7 8] "jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm"][[61 7 9] "afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some"][[61 7 10] "enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once"][[61 7 11] "started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts"][[61 7 12] "of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted"][[61 7 13] "forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted"][[61 7 14] "the sparkling brine into the air."][[61 8 1] "\"Clear away the boats! Luff!\" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he"][[61 8 2] "dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes."][[61 9 1] "The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere"][[61 9 2] "the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,"][[61 9 3] "but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he"][[61 9 4] "swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave"][[61 9 5] "orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in"][[61 9 6] "whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats,"][[61 9 7] "we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the"][[61 9 8] "noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the"][[61 9 9] "monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and"][[61 9 10] "then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up."][[61 10 1] "\"There go flukes!\" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by"][[61 10 2] "Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was"][[61 10 3] "granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale"][[61 10 4] "rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and much"][[61 10 5] "nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honour"][[61 10 6] "of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become"][[61 10 7] "aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no"][[61 10 8] "longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And"][[61 10 9] "still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault."][[61 11 1] "Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,"][[61 11 2] "he was going \"head out\"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad"][[61 11 3] "yeast which he brewed.*"][[61 13 1] "*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance"][[61 13 2] "the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists. Though"][[61 13 3] "apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about"][[61 13 4] "him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does"][[61 13 5] "so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the"][[61 13 6] "upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water"][[61 13 7] "formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he"][[61 13 8] "thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish"][[61 13 9] "galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat."][[61 15 1] "\"Start her, start her, my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of"][[61 15 2] "time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,\" cried"][[61 15 3] "Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \"Start her, now; give 'em"][[61 15 4] "the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy--start"][[61 15 5] "her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the word--easy,"][[61 15 6] "easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the"][[61 15 7] "buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys--that's all. Start"][[61 15 8] "her!\""][[61 16 1] "\"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!\" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some"][[61 16 2] "old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat"][[61 16 3] "involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke"][[61 16 4] "which the eager Indian gave."][[61 17 1] "But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \"Kee-hee!"][[61 17 2] "Kee-hee!\" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,"][[61 17 3] "like a pacing tiger in his cage."][[61 18 1] "\"Ka-la! Koo-loo!\" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a"][[61 18 2] "mouthful of Grenadier's steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels"][[61 18 3] "cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still"][[61 18 4] "encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from"][[61 18 5] "his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the"][[61 18 6] "welcome cry was heard--\"Stand up, Tashtego!--give it to him!\" The"][[61 18 7] "harpoon was hurled. \"Stern all!\" The oarsmen backed water; the same"][[61 18 8] "moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists."][[61 18 9] "It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two"][[61 18 10] "additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its"][[61 18 11] "increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled"][[61 18 12] "with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and"][[61 18 13] "round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it"][[61 18 14] "blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb's hands, from"][[61 18 15] "which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at"][[61 18 16] "these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy's"][[61 18 17] "sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving"][[61 18 18] "to wrest it out of your clutch."][[61 19 1] "\"Wet the line! wet the line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated"][[61 19 2] "by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More"][[61 19 3] "turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now"][[61 19 4] "flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego"][[61 19 5] "here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering business truly in that"][[61 19 6] "rocking commotion."][[61 21 1] "*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be"][[61 21 2] "stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the"][[61 21 3] "running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or"][[61 21 4] "bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most"][[61 21 5] "convenient."][[61 23 1] "From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of"][[61 23 2] "the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would"][[61 23 3] "have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water, the other"][[61 23 4] "the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once."][[61 23 5] "A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in"][[61 23 6] "her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little"][[61 23 7] "finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale"][[61 23 8] "into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging"][[61 23 9] "to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of"][[61 23 10] "Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring"][[61 23 11] "down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed"][[61 23 12] "as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened"][[61 23 13] "his flight."][[61 24 1] "\"Haul in--haul in!\" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round"][[61 24 2] "towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet"][[61 24 3] "the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly"][[61 24 4] "planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the"][[61 24 5] "flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning"][[61 24 6] "out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up for"][[61 24 7] "another fling."][[61 25 1] "The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a"][[61 25 2] "hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled"][[61 25 3] "and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing"][[61 25 4] "upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every"][[61 25 5] "face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all"][[61 25 6] "the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the"][[61 25 7] "spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of"][[61 25 8] "the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked"][[61 25 9] "lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and"][[61 25 10] "again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again"][[61 25 11] "sent it into the whale."][[61 26 1] "\"Pull up--pull up!\" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale"][[61 26 2] "relaxed in his wrath. \"Pull up!--close to!\" and the boat ranged along"][[61 26 3] "the fish's flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned"][[61 26 4] "his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully"][[61 26 5] "churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold"][[61 26 6] "watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of"][[61 26 7] "breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the"][[61 26 8] "innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from"][[61 26 9] "his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \"flurry,\" the monster"][[61 26 10] "horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable,"][[61 26 11] "mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping"][[61 26 12] "astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied"][[61 26 13] "twilight into the clear air of the day."][[61 27 1] "And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;"][[61 27 2] "surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his"][[61 27 3] "spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush"][[61 27 4] "after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red"][[61 27 5] "wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping"][[61 27 6] "down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!"][[61 28 1] "\"He's dead, Mr. Stubb,\" said Daggoo."][[61 29 1] "\"Yes; both pipes smoked out!\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,"][[61 29 2] "Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood"][[61 29 3] "thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made."][[62 0 0] "CHAPTER 62. The Dart."][[62 2 1] "A word concerning an incident in the last chapter."][[62 3 1] "According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes"][[62 3 2] "off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary"][[62 3 3] "steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost"][[62 3 4] "oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous"][[62 3 5] "arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called"][[62 3 6] "a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of"][[62 3 7] "twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase,"][[62 3 8] "the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost;"][[62 3 9] "indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the"][[62 3 10] "rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid"][[62 3 11] "exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's"][[62 3 12] "compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started--what"][[62 3 13] "that is none know but those who have tried it.

No"][[62 3 20] "wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty"][[62 3 21] "fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many"][[62 3 22] "hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some"][[62 3 23] "of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that"][[62 3 24] "some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder"][[62 3 25] "that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the"][[62 3 26] "harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his"][[62 3 27] "body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!"][[62 4 1] "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,"][[62 4 2] "that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer"][[62 4 3] "likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of"][[62 4 4] "themselves and every one else.

I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss"][[62 5 6] "of speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more"][[62 5 7] "than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures"][[62 5 8] "in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the"][[62 5 9] "whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has"][[62 5 10] "caused them."][[62 6 1] "To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this"][[62 6 2] "world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of"][[62 6 3] "toil."][[63 0 0] "CHAPTER 63. The Crotch."][[63 2 1] "Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in"][[63 2 2] "productive subjects, grow the chapters."][[63 3 1] "The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention."][[63 3 2] "It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which"][[63 3 3] "is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow,"][[63 3 4] "for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the"][[63 3 5] "harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow."][[63 3 6] "Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it"][[63 3 7] "up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from"][[63 3 8] "the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,"][[63 3 9] "respectively called the first and second irons."][[63 4 1] "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with"][[63 4 2] "the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one"][[63 4 3] "instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming"][[63 4 4] "drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a"][[63 4 5] "doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the"][[63 4 6] "instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving"][[63 4 7] "the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however"][[63 4 8] "lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him."][[63 4 9] "Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,"][[63 4 10] "and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be"][[63 4 11] "anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the"][[63 4 12] "most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.

Stubb's Supper."][[64 2 1] "Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was"][[64 2 2] "a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow"][[64 2 3] "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men"][[64 2 4] "with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers,"][[64 2 5] "slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the"][[64 2 6] "sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals;"][[64 2 7] "good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we"][[64 2 8] "moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call"][[64 2 9] "it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky"][[64 2 10] "freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we"][[64 2 11] "towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk."][[64 3 1] "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's"][[64 3 2] "main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab"][[64 3 3] "dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing"][[64 3 4] "the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing"][[64 3 5] "it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way"][[64 3 6] "into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning."][[64 4 1] "Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had"][[64 4 2] "evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature"][[64 4 3] "was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed"][[64 4 4] "working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that"][[64 4 5] "Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were"][[64 4 6] "brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand,"][[64 4 7] "monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on"][[64 4 8] "the Pequod's decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in"][[64 4 9] "the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust"][[64 4 10] "rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast"][[64 4 11] "corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the"][[64 4 12] "stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black"][[64 4 13] "hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night,"][[64 4 14] "which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale,"][[64 4 15] "seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while"][[64 4 16] "the other remains standing.*"][[64 6 1] "*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most"][[64 6 2] "reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,"][[64 6 3] "is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part"][[64 6 4] "is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its"][[64 6 5] "flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so"][[64 6 6] "that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to"][[64 6 7] "put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a"][[64 6 8] "small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and"][[64 6 9] "a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By"][[64 6 10] "adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side"][[64 6 11] "of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily"][[64 6 12] "made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked"][[64 6 13] "fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with"][[64 6 14] "its broad flukes or lobes."][[64 8 1] "If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known"][[64 8 2] "on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an"][[64 8 3] "unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was"][[64 8 4] "he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned"][[64 8 5] "to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping"][[64 8 6] "cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest."][[64 8 7] "Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale"][[64 8 8] "as a flavorish thing to his palate."][[64 9 1] "\"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!

Nor was Stubb"][[64 11 4] "the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings"][[64 11 5] "with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming"][[64 11 6] "round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.

Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you"][[64 11 10] "heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on"][[64 11 11] "their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the"][[64 11 12] "bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all"][[64 11 13] "but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they"][[64 11 14] "contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the"][[64 11 15] "universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale,"][[64 11 16] "may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking"][[64 11 17] "for a screw."][[64 12 1] "Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks"][[64 12 2] "will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs"][[64 12 3] "round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down"][[64 12 4] "every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant"][[64 12 5] "butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's"][[64 12 6] "live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,"][[64 12 7] "also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away"][[64 12 8] "under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole"][[64 12 9] "affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that"][[64 12 10] "is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and"][[64 12 11] "though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships"][[64 12 12] "crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in"][[64 12 13] "case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently"][[64 12 14] "buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down,"][[64 12 15] "touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most"][[64 12 16] "socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no"][[64 12 17] "conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless"][[64 12 18] "numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm"][[64 12 19] "whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea.

That blubber is something of the consistence"][[68 3 3] "of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and"][[68 3 4] "ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness."][[68 4 1] "Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's"][[68 4 2] "skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point"][[68 4 3] "of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you"][[68 4 4] "cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but"][[68 4 5] "that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if"][[68 4 6] "reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred"][[68 4 7] "dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely"][[68 4 8] "thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds"][[68 4 9] "of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,"][[68 4 10] "previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but"][[68 4 11] "becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which"][[68 4 12] "I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;"][[68 4 13] "and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself"][[68 4 14] "with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is"][[68 4 15] "pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may"][[68 4 16] "say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin,"][[68 4 17] "isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the"][[68 4 18] "whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as"][[68 4 19] "the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say,"][[68 4 20] "that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender"][[68 4 21] "than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this."][[68 5 1] "Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,"][[68 5 2] "as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one"][[68 5 3] "hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or"][[68 5 4] "rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,"][[68 5 5] "and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had"][[68 5 6] "of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere"][[68 5 7] "integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels"][[68 5 8] "to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters"][[68 5 9] "of the stuff of the whale's skin."][[68 6 1] "In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among"][[68 6 2] "the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely"][[68 6 3] "crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,"][[68 6 4] "something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these"][[68 6 5] "marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above"][[68 6 6] "mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved"][[68 6 7] "upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,"][[68 6 8] "observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but"][[68 6 9] "afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical;"][[68 6 10] "that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids"][[68 6 11] "hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present"][[68 6 12] "connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm"][[68 6 13] "Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old"][[68 6 14] "Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on"][[68 6 15] "the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the"][[68 6 16] "mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian"][[68 6 17] "rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which"][[68 6 18] "the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the"][[68 6 19] "back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the"][[68 6 20] "regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,"][[68 6 21] "altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New"][[68 6 22] "England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks"][[68 6 23] "of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I should say,"][[68 6 24] "that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this"][[68 6 25] "particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are"][[68 6 26] "probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most"][[68 6 27] "remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species."][[68 7 1] "A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of"][[68 7 2] "the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long"][[68 7 3] "pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very"][[68 7 4] "happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber"][[68 7 5] "as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho"][[68 7 6] "slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this"][[68 7 7] "cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself"][[68 7 8] "comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would"][[68 7 9] "become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the"][[68 7 10] "North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are"][[68 7 11] "found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it"][[68 7 12] "observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies"][[68 7 13] "are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of"][[68 7 14] "an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire;"][[68 7 15] "whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood,"][[68 7 16] "and he dies. How wonderful is it then--except after explanation--that"][[68 7 17] "this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it"][[68 7 18] "is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed"][[68 7 19] "to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall"][[68 7 20] "overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly"][[68 7 21] "frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued"][[68 7 22] "in amber.

But as she was so far to windward, and shooting"][[71 3 3] "by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could"][[71 3 4] "not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would"][[71 3 5] "be made."][[71 4 1] "Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of"][[71 4 2] "the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals"][[71 4 3] "being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels"][[71 4 4] "attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale"][[71 4 5] "commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at"][[71 4 6] "considerable distances and with no small facility."][[71 5 1] "The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting"][[71 5 2] "her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring"][[71 5 3] "her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod's lee, and"][[71 5 4] "lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being"][[71 5 5] "rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain, the"][[71 5 6] "stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token"][[71 5 7] "of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that"][[71 5 8] "the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her"][[71 5 9] "captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's company. For, though"][[71 5 10] "himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half"][[71 5 11] "a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing"][[71 5 12] "between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the"][[71 5 13] "land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the"][[71 5 14] "Pequod."][[71 6 1] "But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an"][[71 6 2] "interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam's"][[71 6 3] "boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the"][[71 6 4] "Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew"][[71 6 5] "very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by"][[71 6 6] "the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some"][[71 6 7] "way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings"][[71 6 8] "again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a"][[71 6 9] "conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not"][[71 6 10] "without still another interruption of a very different sort."][[71 7 1] "Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular"][[71 7 2] "appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities"][[71 7 3] "make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled"][[71 7 4] "all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A"][[71 7 5] "long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped"][[71 7 6] "him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A"][[71 7 7] "deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes."][[71 8 1] "So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had"][[71 8 2] "exclaimed--\"That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the"][[71 8 3] "Town-Ho's company told us of!\" Stubb here alluded to a strange story"][[71 8 4] "told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time"][[71 8 5] "previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account"][[71 8 6] "and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in"][[71 8 7] "question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the"][[71 8 8] "Jeroboam. His story was this:"][[71 9 1] "He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna"][[71 9 2] "Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret"][[71 9 3] "meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a"][[71 9 4] "trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he"][[71 9 5] "carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,"][[71 9 6] "was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim"][[71 9 7] "having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with"][[71 9 8] "that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense"][[71 9 9] "exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the"][[71 9 10] "Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon"][[71 9 11] "the ship's getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a"][[71 9 12] "freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded"][[71 9 13] "the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby"][[71 9 14] "he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and"][[71 9 15] "vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he"][[71 9 16] "declared these things;--the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited"][[71 9 17] "imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united"][[71 9 18] "to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant"][[71 9 19] "crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of"][[71 9 20] "him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,"][[71 9 21] "especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous"][[71 9 22] "captain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that"][[71 9 23] "individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the"][[71 9 24] "archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship"][[71 9 25] "and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was"][[71 9 26] "carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew,"][[71 9 27] "that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel"][[71 9 28] "was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore"][[71 9 29] "forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any"][[71 9 30] "way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that"][[71 9 31] "Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all"][[71 9 32] "this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and"][[71 9 33] "mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand"][[71 9 34] "than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole"][[71 9 35] "command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure."][[71 9 36] "The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before"][[71 9 37] "him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal"][[71 9 38] "homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however"][[71 9 39] "wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking"][[71 9 40] "in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as"][[71 9 41] "his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But"][[71 9 42] "it is time to return to the Pequod."][[71 10 1] "\"I fear not thy epidemic, man,\" said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain"][[71 10 2] "Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; \"come on board.\""][[71 11 1] "But now Gabriel started to his feet."][[71 12 1] "\"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible"][[71 12 2] "plague!\""][[71 13 1] "\"Gabriel! Gabriel!\" cried Captain Mayhew; \"thou must either--\" But"][[71 13 2] "that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings"][[71 13 3] "drowned all speech."][[71 14 1] "\"Hast thou seen the White Whale?\" demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted"][[71 14 2] "back."][[71 15 1] "\"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible"][[71 15 2] "tail!\""][[71 16 1] "\"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--\" But again the boat tore ahead as if"][[71 16 2] "dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession"][[71 16 3] "of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices"][[71 16 4] "of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm"][[71 16 5] "whale's head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing"][[71 16 6] "it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to"][[71 16 7] "warrant."][[71 17 1] "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story"][[71 17 2] "concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from"][[71 17 3] "Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed"][[71 17 4] "leagued with him."][[71 18 1] "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking"][[71 18 2] "a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby"][[71 18 3] "Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,"][[71 18 4] "Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White"][[71 18 5] "Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity,"][[71 18 6] "pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God"][[71 18 7] "incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two"][[71 18 8] "afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the"][[71 18 9] "chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself"][[71 18 10] "being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all"][[71 18 11] "the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in"][[71 18 12] "persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after"][[71 18 13] "much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last"][[71 18 14] "succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to"][[71 18 15] "the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and"][[71 18 16] "hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants"][[71 18 17] "of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his"][[71 18 18] "boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting"][[71 18 19] "his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance"][[71 18 20] "for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its"][[71 18 21] "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies"][[71 18 22] "of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious"][[71 18 23] "life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his"][[71 18 24] "descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a"][[71 18 25] "chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the"][[71 18 26] "mate for ever sank."][[71 19 1] "It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the"][[71 19 2] "Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any."][[71 19 3] "Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;"][[71 19 4] "oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the"][[71 19 5] "headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But"][[71 19 6] "strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,"][[71 19 7] "when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is"][[71 19 8] "discernible; the man being stark dead."][[71 20 1] "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried"][[71 20 2] "from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek--\"The vial! the vial!\" Gabriel"][[71 20 3] "called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the"][[71 20 4] "whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;"][[71 20 5] "because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically"][[71 20 6] "fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any"][[71 20 7] "one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the"][[71 20 8] "wide margin allowed.

Thus,"][[71 23 4] "most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after"][[71 23 5] "attaining an age of two or three years or more."][[71 24 1] "Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,"][[71 24 2] "damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence"][[71 24 3] "of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death"][[71 24 4] "himself might well have been the post-boy."][[71 25 1] "\"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab. \"Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but"][[71 25 2] "a dim scrawl;--what's this?\" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a"][[71 25 3] "long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to"][[71 25 4] "insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without"][[71 25 5] "its coming any closer to the ship."][[71 26 1] "Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har--yes, Mr."][[71 26 2] "Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr."][[71 26 3] "Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!\""][[71 27 1] "\"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,\" sighed Mayhew; \"but let"][[71 27 2] "me have it.\""][[71 28 1] "\"Nay, keep it thyself,\" cried Gabriel to Ahab; \"thou art soon going that"][[71 28 2] "way.\""][[71 29 1] "\"Curses throttle thee!\" yelled Ahab. \"Captain Mayhew, stand by now to"][[71 29 2] "receive it\"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands, he"][[71 29 3] "caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat."][[71 29 4] "But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat"][[71 29 5] "drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by magic, the"][[71 29 6] "letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it"][[71 29 7] "in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,"][[71 29 8] "sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then"][[71 29 9] "Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in"][[71 29 10] "that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod."][[71 30 1] "As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket"][[71 30 2] "of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild"][[71 30 3] "affair."][[72 0 0] "CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope."][[72 2 1] "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there"][[72 2 2] "is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are"][[72 2 3] "wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying"][[72 2 4] "in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done"][[72 2 5] "everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description"][[72 2 6] "of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned"][[72 2 7] "that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook"][[72 2 8] "was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the"][[72 2 9] "mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook"][[72 2 10] "get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend"][[72 2 11] "Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the"][[72 2 12] "monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many"][[72 2 13] "cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the"][[72 2 14] "whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The"][[72 2 15] "whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the"][[72 2 16] "immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the"][[72 2 17] "level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the"][[72 2 18] "whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill"][[72 2 19] "beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the"][[72 2 20] "Highland costume--a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least,"][[72 2 21] "he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to"][[72 2 22] "observe him, as will presently be seen."][[72 3 1] "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar"][[72 3 2] "in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to"][[72 3 3] "attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead"][[72 3 4] "whale's back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by"][[72 3 5] "a long cord. Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg"][[72 3 6] "down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery"][[72 3 7] "a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his"][[72 3 8] "waist."][[72 4 1] "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we"][[72 4 2] "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at"][[72 4 3] "both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow"][[72 4 4] "leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were"][[72 4 5] "wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage"][[72 4 6] "and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag"][[72 4 7] "me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us."][[72 4 8] "Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get"][[72 4 9] "rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed."][[72 5 1] "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that"][[72 5 2] "while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive"][[72 5 3] "that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of"][[72 5 4] "two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's"][[72 5 5] "mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster"][[72 5 6] "and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in"][[72 5 7] "Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an"][[72 5 8] "injustice. And yet still further pondering--while I jerked him now"][[72 5 9] "and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam"][[72 5 10] "him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine"][[72 5 11] "was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most"][[72 5 12] "cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality"][[72 5 13] "of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by"][[72 5 14] "mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say"][[72 5 15] "that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the"][[72 5 16] "multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's"][[72 5 17] "monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came"][[72 5 18] "very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I"][[72 5 19] "would, I only had the management of one end of it.*"][[72 7 1] "*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod"][[72 7 2] "that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement"][[72 7 3] "upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb,"][[72 7 4] "in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible"][[72 7 5] "guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder."][[72 9 1] "I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the"][[72 9 2] "whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant"][[72 9 3] "rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy"][[72 9 4] "he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the"][[72 9 5] "night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent"][[72 9 6] "blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed"][[72 9 7] "round it like bees in a beehive."][[72 10 1] "And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them"][[72 10 2] "aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were"][[72 10 3] "it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise"][[72 10 4] "miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man."][[72 11 1] "Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a"][[72 11 2] "ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them."][[72 11 3] "Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked"][[72 11 4] "the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed"][[72 11 5] "a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still another"][[72 11 6] "protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego"][[72 11 7] "and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen"][[72 11 8] "whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could"][[72 11 9] "reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and"][[72 11 10] "benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best happiness, I admit; but"][[72 11 11] "in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both"][[72 11 12] "he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water,"][[72 11 13] "those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg"][[72 11 14] "than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there"][[72 11 15] "with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his"][[72 11 16] "Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods."][[72 12 1] "Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in"][[72 12 2] "and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters"][[72 12 3] "it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men"][[72 12 4] "in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those"][[72 12 5] "sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks"][[72 12 6] "and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad."][[72 13 1] "But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.

The first contained strong spirits, and was"][[72 23 3] "handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was"][[72 23 4] "freely given to the waves."][[73 0 0] "CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk"][[73 0 1] "Over Him."][[73 2 1] "It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's"][[73 2 2] "prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side. But we must let it"][[73 2 3] "continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it."][[73 2 4] "For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the"][[73 2 5] "head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold."][[73 3 1] "Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually"][[73 3 2] "drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,"][[73 3 3] "gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the"][[73 3 4] "Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking"][[73 3 5] "anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of"][[73 3 6] "those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to"][[73 3 7] "cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near"][[73 3 8] "the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale"][[73 3 9] "had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the"][[73 3 10] "announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if"][[73 3 11] "opportunity offered."][[73 4 1] "Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two"][[73 4 2] "boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further"][[73 4 3] "and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at"][[73 4 4] "the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of"][[73 4 5] "tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or"][[73 4 6] "both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in"][[73 4 7] "plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the"][[73 4 8] "towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at"][[73 4 9] "first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a"][[73 4 10] "maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from"][[73 4 11] "view, as if diving under the keel. \"Cut, cut!\" was the cry from the"][[73 4 12] "ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being"][[73 4 13] "brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side. But having plenty"][[73 4 14] "of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they"][[73 4 15] "paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their"][[73 4 16] "might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was"][[73 4 17] "intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line"][[73 4 18] "in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending"][[73 4 19] "strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance"][[73 4 20] "they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when"][[73 4 21] "instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the"][[73 4 22] "keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose"][[73 4 23] "to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its"][[73 4 24] "drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water,"][[73 4 25] "while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were"][[73 4 26] "free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering"][[73 4 27] "his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after"][[73 4 28] "him, so that they performed a complete circuit."][[73 5 1] "Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close"][[73 5 2] "flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for"][[73 5 3] "lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the"][[73 5 4] "multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's body,"][[73 5 5] "rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every"][[73 5 6] "new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that"][[73 5 7] "poured from the smitten rock."][[73 6 1] "At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he"][[73 6 2] "turned upon his back a corpse."][[73 7 1] "While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,"][[73 7 2] "and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some"][[73 7 3] "conversation ensued between them."][[73 8 1] "\"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\" said"][[73 8 2] "Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so"][[73 8 3] "ignoble a leviathan."][[73 9 1] "\"Wants with it?\" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's bow,"][[73 9 2] "\"did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale's"][[73 9 3] "head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale's"][[73 9 4] "on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never"][[73 9 5] "afterwards capsize?\""][[73 10 1] "\"Why not?"][[73 11 1] "\"I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,"][[73 11 2] "and he seems to know all about ships' charms.

The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View."][[74 2 1] "Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us"][[74 2 2] "join them, and lay together our own."][[74 3 1] "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right"][[74 3 2] "Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly"][[74 3 3] "hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all"][[74 3 4] "the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between"][[74 3 5] "them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this"][[74 3 6] "moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one"][[74 3 7] "to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:--where, I should like"][[74 3 8] "to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology"][[74 3 9] "than here?"][[74 4 1] "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these"][[74 4 2] "heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain"][[74 4 3] "mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly"][[74 4 4] "lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold"][[74 4 5] "it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point"][[74 4 6] "of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is"][[74 4 7] "heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,"][[74 4 8] "giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what"][[74 4 9] "the fishermen technically call a \"grey-headed whale.\""][[74 5 1] "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the two"][[74 5 2] "most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of"][[74 5 3] "the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you"][[74 5 4] "narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would"][[74 5 5] "fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it to the"][[74 5 6] "magnitude of the head."][[74 6 1] "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is"][[74 6 2] "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more"][[74 6 3] "than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale's"][[74 6 4] "eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for"][[74 6 5] "yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects"][[74 6 6] "through your ears. You would find that you could only command some"][[74 6 7] "thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;"][[74 6 8] "and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking"][[74 6 9] "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not"][[74 6 10] "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from"][[74 6 11] "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the"][[74 6 12] "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the"][[74 6 13] "front of a man--what, indeed, but his eyes?"][[74 7 1] "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes"][[74 7 2] "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to"][[74 7 3] "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of"][[74 7 4] "the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of"][[74 7 5] "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating"][[74 7 6] "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the"][[74 7 7] "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,"][[74 7 8] "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct"][[74 7 9] "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and"][[74 7 10] "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world"][[74 7 11] "from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the"][[74 7 12] "whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct"][[74 7 13] "windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's"][[74 7 14] "eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be"][[74 7 15] "remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes."][[74 8 1] "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this"][[74 8 2] "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a"][[74 8 3] "hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing"][[74 8 4] "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing"][[74 8 5] "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience"][[74 8 6] "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of"][[74 8 7] "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,"][[74 8 8] "and completely, to examine any two things--however large or however"][[74 8 9] "small--at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side"][[74 8 10] "by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two"][[74 8 11] "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in"][[74 8 12] "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to"][[74 8 13] "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary"][[74 8 14] "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,"][[74 8 15] "in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more"][[74 8 16] "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same"][[74 8 17] "moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one"][[74 8 18] "side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he"][[74 8 19] "can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able"][[74 8 20] "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems"][[74 8 21] "in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this"][[74 8 22] "comparison."][[74 9 1] "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the"][[74 9 2] "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when"][[74 9 3] "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer"][[74 9 4] "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly"][[74 9 5] "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their"][[74 9 6] "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them."][[74 10 1] "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an"][[74 10 2] "entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads"][[74 10 3] "for hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf"][[74 10 4] "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so"][[74 10 5] "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With"][[74 10 6] "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed"][[74 10 7] "between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has"][[74 10 8] "an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered"][[74 10 9] "over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without."][[74 11 1] "Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the"][[74 11 2] "world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which"][[74 11 3] "is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of"][[74 11 4] "Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of"][[74 11 5] "cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of"][[74 11 6] "hearing? Not at all.--Why then do you try to \"enlarge\" your mind?"][[74 11 7] "Subtilize it."][[74 12 1] "Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant"][[74 12 2] "over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending"][[74 12 3] "by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not"][[74 12 4] "that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we"][[74 12 5] "might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But"][[74 12 6] "let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What"][[74 12 7] "a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,"][[74 12 8] "lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as"][[74 12 9] "bridal satins."][[74 13 1] "But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems"][[74 13 2] "like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one"][[74 13 3] "end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,"][[74 13 4] "and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,"][[74 13 5] "alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these"][[74 13 6] "spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,"][[74 13 7] "when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there"][[74 13 8] "suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging"][[74 13 9] "straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a"][[74 13 10] "ship's jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of"][[74 13 11] "sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his"][[74 13 12] "jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a"][[74 13 13] "reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon"][[74 13 14] "him."][[74 14 1] "In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised"][[74 14 2] "artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting"][[74 14 3] "the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone"][[74 14 4] "with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,"][[74 14 5] "including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips."][[74 15 1] "With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an"][[74 15 2] "anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the other"][[74 15 3] "work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,"][[74 15 4] "are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances"][[74 15 5] "the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being"][[74 15 6] "rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag"][[74 15 7] "stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two"][[74 15 8] "teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled"][[74 15 9] "after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and"][[74 15 10] "piled away like joists for building houses."][[75 0 0] "CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View."][[75 2 1] "Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale's"][[75 2 2] "head."][[75 3 1] "As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a"][[75 3 2] "Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);"][[75 3 3] "so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather inelegant"][[75 3 4] "resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an"][[75 3 5] "old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last. And"][[75 3 6] "in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with"][[75 3 7] "the swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her"][[75 3 8] "progeny."][[75 4 1] "But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different"][[75 4 2] "aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and"][[75 4 3] "look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head"][[75 4 4] "for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its"][[75 4 5] "sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,"][[75 4 6] "crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass--this green,"][[75 4 7] "barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the \"crown,\" and the"][[75 4 8] "Southern fishers the \"bonnet\" of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes"][[75 4 9] "solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,"][[75 4 10] "with a bird's nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live"][[75 4 11] "crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost"][[75 4 12] "sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the"][[75 4 13] "technical term \"crown\" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will"][[75 4 14] "take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a"][[75 4 15] "diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for"][[75 4 16] "him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very"][[75 4 17] "sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!"][[75 4 18] "what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's"][[75 4 19] "measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout"][[75 4 20] "that will yield you some  gallons of oil and more."][[75 5 1] "A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped."][[75 5 2] "The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an"][[75 5 3] "important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes"][[75 5 4] "caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold,"][[75 5 5] "we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should"][[75 5 6] "take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the"][[75 5 7] "road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a"][[75 5 8] "pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while"][[75 5 9] "these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half"][[75 5 10] "vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a"][[75 5 11] "side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown"][[75 5 12] "bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily"][[75 5 13] "mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,"][[75 5 14] "through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose"][[75 5 15] "intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through"][[75 5 16] "the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they"][[75 5 17] "stand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves,"][[75 5 18] "hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age,"][[75 5 19] "as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty of this"][[75 5 20] "criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical"][[75 5 21] "probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater"][[75 5 22] "age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable."][[75 6 1] "In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies"][[75 6 2] "concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous"][[75 6 3] "\"whiskers\" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, \"hogs' bristles\"; a"][[75 6 4] "third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:"][[75 6 5] "\"There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his"][[75 6 6] "upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.\""][[75 8 1] "*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or"][[75 8 2] "rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the"][[75 8 3] "upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these"][[75 8 4] "tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn"][[75 8 5] "countenance."][[75 10 1] "As every one knows, these same \"hogs' bristles,\" \"fins,\" \"whiskers,\""][[75 10 2] "\"blinds,\" or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and"][[75 10 3] "other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has"][[75 10 4] "long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne's time that the bone was"][[75 10 5] "in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those"][[75 10 6] "ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as"][[75 10 7] "you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we"][[75 10 8] "nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a"][[75 10 9] "tent spread over the same bone."][[75 11 1] "But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing"][[75 11 2] "in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these"][[75 11 3] "colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think"][[75 11 4] "you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its"][[75 11 5] "thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest"][[75 11 6] "Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the"][[75 11 7] "mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting"][[75 11 8] "it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I"][[75 11 9] "should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that"][[75 11 10] "amount of oil."][[75 12 1] "Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started"][[75 12 2] "with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely"][[75 12 3] "different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no great"][[75 12 4] "well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a"][[75 12 5] "lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any"][[75 12 6] "of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a"][[75 12 7] "tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm"][[75 12 8] "Whale only one."][[75 13 1] "Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie"][[75 13 2] "together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will"][[75 13 3] "not be very long in following."][[75 14 1] "Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there? It is the same"][[75 14 2] "he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem"][[75 14 3] "now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like"][[75 14 4] "placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the"][[75 14 5] "other head's expression.

Does not"][[75 14 7] "this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in"][[75 14 8] "facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm"][[75 14 9] "Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years."][[76 0 0] "CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram."][[76 2 1] "Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have"][[76 2 2] "you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its front"][[76 2 3] "aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate"][[76 2 4] "it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,"][[76 2 5] "intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged"][[76 2 6] "there. Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle"][[76 2 7] "this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of"][[76 2 8] "the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be"][[76 2 9] "found in all recorded history."][[76 3 1] "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,"][[76 3 2] "the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the"][[76 3 3] "water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably"][[76 3 4] "backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which"][[76 3 5] "receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely"][[76 3 6] "under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth"][[76 3 7] "were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has"][[76 3 8] "no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole--is on the"][[76 3 9] "top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides"][[76 3 10] "of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front."][[76 3 11] "Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm"][[76 3 12] "Whale's head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender"][[76 3 13] "prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider"][[76 3 14] "that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of"][[76 3 15] "the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you"][[76 3 16] "get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial"][[76 3 17] "development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad."][[76 3 18] "Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise"][[76 3 19] "the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of"][[76 3 20] "the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy."][[76 3 21] "In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the"][[76 3 22] "body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head;"][[76 3 23] "but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so"][[76 3 24] "thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not"][[76 3 25] "handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by"][[76 3 26] "the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though"][[76 3 27] "the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs. I do not"][[76 3 28] "think that any sensation lurks in it."][[76 4 1] "Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen"][[76 4 2] "chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the"][[76 4 3] "sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming"][[76 4 4] "contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold"][[76 4 5] "there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest"][[76 4 6] "and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which"][[76 4 7] "would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By"][[76 4 8] "itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But"][[76 4 9] "supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that"][[76 4 10] "as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,"][[76 4 11] "capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,"][[76 4 12] "as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too,"][[76 4 13] "the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head"][[76 4 14] "altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out"][[76 4 15] "of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;"][[76 4 16] "considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically"][[76 4 17] "occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there"][[76 4 18] "may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with"][[76 4 19] "the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and"][[76 4 20] "contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to"][[76 4 21] "which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes."][[76 5 1] "Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable"][[76 5 2] "wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a"][[76 5 3] "mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood"][[76 5 4] "is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest"][[76 5 5] "insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the"][[76 5 6] "specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this"][[76 5 7] "expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable"][[76 5 8] "braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant"][[76 5 9] "incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale"][[76 5 10] "stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic"][[76 5 11] "with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For"][[76 5 12] "unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist"][[76 5 13] "in Truth.

But to comprehend it aright, you must"][[77 2 2] "know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated"][[77 2 3] "upon."][[77 3 1] "Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an"][[77 3 2] "inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower"][[77 3 3] "is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an"][[77 3 4] "unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the"][[77 3 5] "expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the"][[77 3 6] "forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two"][[77 3 7] "almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal"][[77 3 8] "wall of a thick tendinous substance."][[77 5 1] "*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical"][[77 5 2] "mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a"][[77 5 3] "solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the"][[77 5 4] "steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both"][[77 5 5] "sides."][[77 7 1] "The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb"][[77 7 2] "of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand"][[77 7 3] "infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole"][[77 7 4] "extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great"][[77 7 5] "Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is"][[77 7 6] "mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms"][[77 7 7] "innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his"][[77 7 8] "wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished"][[77 7 9] "with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun"][[77 7 10] "of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;"][[77 7 11] "namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid,"][[77 7 12] "and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed"][[77 7 13] "in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly"][[77 7 14] "fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to"][[77 7 15] "concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the"][[77 7 16] "first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale's"][[77 7 17] "case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from"][[77 7 18] "unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and"][[77 7 19] "dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business"][[77 7 20] "of securing what you can."][[77 8 1] "I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun"][[77 8 2] "was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not"][[77 8 3] "possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the"][[77 8 4] "lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale's"][[77 8 5] "case."][[77 9 1] "It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale"][[77 9 2] "embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since--as"][[77 9 3] "has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third of the whole"][[77 9 4] "length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for"][[77 9 5] "a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth"][[77 9 6] "of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's"][[77 9 7] "side."][[77 10 1] "As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought close"][[77 10 2] "to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti"][[77 10 3] "magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,"][[77 10 4] "untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its"][[77 10 5] "invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which"][[77 10 6] "is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by"][[77 10 7] "the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side,"][[77 10 8] "make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter."][[77 11 1] "Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and--in"][[77 11 2] "this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm"][[77 11 3] "Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped."][[78 0 0] "CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets."][[78 2 1] "Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect"][[78 2 2] "posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the"][[78 2 3] "part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried"][[78 2 4] "with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,"][[78 2 5] "travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that"][[78 2 6] "it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it"][[78 2 7] "is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down"][[78 2 8] "the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he"][[78 2 9] "lands on the summit of the head. There--still high elevated above the"][[78 2 10] "rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish"][[78 2 11] "Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A"][[78 2 12] "short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches"][[78 2 13] "for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business"][[78 2 14] "he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,"][[78 2 15] "sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time"][[78 2 16] "this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like"][[78 2 17] "a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other"][[78 2 18] "end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three"][[78 2 19] "alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian,"][[78 2 20] "to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this"][[78 2 21] "pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun,"][[78 2 22] "till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the"][[78 2 23] "whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail"][[78 2 24] "of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted"][[78 2 25] "vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large"][[78 2 26] "tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round until"][[78 2 27] "the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to"][[78 2 28] "ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun,"][[78 2 29] "until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down."][[78 3 1] "Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;"][[78 3 2] "several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a"][[78 3 3] "queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,"][[78 3 4] "was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed"][[78 3 5] "hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the"][[78 3 6] "place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil"][[78 3 7] "One himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular"][[78 3 8] "reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden,"][[78 3 9] "as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up--my God! poor"][[78 3 10] "Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,"][[78 3 11] "dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with"][[78 3 12] "a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!"][[78 4 1] "\"Man overboard!\" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first"][[78 4 2] "came to his senses. \"Swing the bucket this way!\" and putting one foot"][[78 4 3] "into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip"][[78 4 4] "itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost"][[78 4 5] "before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime,"][[78 4 6] "there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before"][[78 4 7] "lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,"][[78 4 8] "as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only"][[78 4 9] "the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous"][[78 4 10] "depth to which he had sunk."][[78 5 1] "At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing"][[78 5 2] "the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles--a"][[78 5 3] "sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,"][[78 5 4] "one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with"][[78 5 5] "a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship"][[78 5 6] "reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,"][[78 5 7] "upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be"][[78 5 8] "on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent"][[78 5 9] "motions of the head."][[78 6 1] "\"Come down, come down!\" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand"][[78 6 2] "holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he"][[78 6 3] "would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,"][[78 6 4] "rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the"][[78 6 5] "buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out."][[78 7 1] "\"In heaven's name, man,\" cried Stubb, \"are you ramming home a cartridge"][[78 7 2] "there?--Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on"][[78 7 3] "top of his head? Avast, will ye!\""][[78 8 1] "\"Stand clear of the tackle!\" cried a voice like the bursting of a"][[78 8 2] "rocket."][[78 9 1] "Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass"][[78 9 2] "dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the"][[78 9 3] "suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering"][[78 9 4] "copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now over the"][[78 9 5] "sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a thick mist of"][[78 9 6] "spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,"][[78 9 7] "buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!"][[78 9 8] "But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away, when a naked figure"][[78 9 9] "with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen"][[78 9 10] "hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my"][[78 9 11] "brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the"][[78 9 12] "side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and"][[78 9 13] "no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now"][[78 9 14] "jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship."][[78 10 1] "\"Ha! ha!\" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch"][[78 10 2] "overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust"][[78 10 3] "upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust"][[78 10 4] "forth from the grass over a grave."][[78 11 1] "\"Both! both!--it is both!\"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and"][[78 11 2] "soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and"][[78 11 3] "with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the"][[78 11 4] "waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was"][[78 11 5] "long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk."][[78 12 1] "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after"][[78 12 2] "the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made"][[78 12 3] "side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then"][[78 12 4] "dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,"][[78 12 5] "and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first"][[78 12 6] "thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that"][[78 12 7] "was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had"][[78 12 8] "thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a"][[78 12 9] "somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in"][[78 12 10] "the good old way--head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was"][[78 12 11] "doing as well as could be expected."][[78 13 1] "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,"][[78 13 2] "the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully"][[78 13 3] "accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently"][[78 13 4] "hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten."][[78 13 5] "Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,"][[78 13 6] "riding and rowing."][[78 14 1] "I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to"][[78 14 2] "seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either"][[78 14 3] "seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an accident"][[78 14 4] "which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the"][[78 14 5] "Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the"][[78 14 6] "Sperm Whale's well."][[78 15 1] "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought"][[78 15 2] "the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and"][[78 15 3] "most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of"][[78 15 4] "a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at"][[78 15 5] "all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been"][[78 15 6] "nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense"][[78 15 7] "tendinous wall of the well--a double welded, hammered substance, as I"][[78 15 8] "have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which"][[78 15 9] "sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this"][[78 15 10] "substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the"][[78 15 11] "other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank"][[78 15 12] "very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance"][[78 15 13] "for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it"][[78 15 14] "was a running delivery, so it was."][[78 16 1] "Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious"][[78 16 2] "perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant"][[78 16 3] "spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber"][[78 16 4] "and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be"][[78 16 5] "recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey"][[78 16 6] "in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that"][[78 16 7] "leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed."][[78 16 8] "How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's honey head, and"][[78 16 9] "sweetly perished there?"][[79 0 0] "CHAPTER 79. The Prairie."][[79 2 1] "To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this"][[79 2 2] "Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as"][[79 2 3] "yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for"][[79 2 4] "Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,"][[79 2 5] "or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the"][[79 2 6] "Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats"][[79 2 7] "of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces"][[79 2 8] "of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the"][[79 2 9] "modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and"][[79 2 10] "his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the"][[79 2 11] "phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,"][[79 2 12] "though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these"][[79 2 13] "two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things;"][[79 2 14] "I achieve what I can."][[79 3 1] "Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature."][[79 3 2] "He has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most"][[79 3 3] "conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and"][[79 3 4] "finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that its"][[79 3 5] "entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect"][[79 3 6] "the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,"][[79 3 7] "cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable"][[79 3 8] "to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in"][[79 3 9] "keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose"][[79 3 10] "from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless,"][[79 3 11] "Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so"][[79 3 12] "stately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were"][[79 3 13] "hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A"][[79 3 14] "nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical"][[79 3 15] "voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble"][[79 3 16] "conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a"][[79 3 17] "nose to be pulled.

Human or animal, the mystical brow is as"][[79 5 5] "that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees."][[79 5 6] "It signifies--\"God: done this day by my hand.\" But in most creatures,"][[79 5 7] "nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine"][[79 5 8] "land lying along the snow line.

For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is"][[79 5 18] "revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper;"][[79 5 19] "nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with"][[79 5 20] "riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men."][[79 5 21] "Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way"][[79 5 22] "viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so.

The Nut."][[80 2 1] "If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his"][[80 2 2] "brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square."][[80 3 1] "In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet"][[80 3 2] "in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as"][[80 3 3] "the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level"][[80 3 4] "base. But in life--as we have elsewhere seen--this inclined plane is"][[80 3 5] "angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent"][[80 3 6] "mass of the junk and sperm.

The brain is at"][[80 3 10] "least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden"][[80 3 11] "away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the"][[80 3 12] "amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it"][[80 3 13] "secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny"][[80 3 14] "that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance"][[80 3 15] "of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange"][[80 3 16] "folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more"][[80 3 17] "in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part"][[80 3 18] "of him as the seat of his intelligence."][[80 4 1] "It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in"][[80 4 2] "the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his"][[80 4 3] "true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.

Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down"][[80 5 5] "to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls, and you would"][[80 5 6] "involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on"][[80 5 7] "one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say--This"][[80 5 8] "man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.

If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine,"][[80 6 4] "you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung"][[80 6 5] "necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the"][[80 6 6] "skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely"][[80 6 7] "undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it"][[80 6 8] "the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once"][[80 6 9] "pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with"][[80 6 10] "the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the"][[80 6 11] "beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have"][[80 6 12] "omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the"][[80 6 13] "cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man's"][[80 6 14] "character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel"][[80 6 15] "your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine"][[80 6 16] "never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the"][[80 6 17] "firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world."][[80 7 1] "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial"][[80 7 2] "cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra"][[80 7 3] "the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being"][[80 7 4] "eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As"][[80 7 5] "it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but"][[80 7 6] "for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,"][[80 7 7] "this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance--the"][[80 7 8] "spinal cord--as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain."][[80 7 9] "And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain's"][[80 7 10] "cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost"][[80 7 11] "equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be"][[80 7 12] "unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically?"][[80 7 13] "For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his"][[80 7 14] "brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative"][[80 7 15] "magnitude of his spinal cord."][[80 8 1] "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I"][[80 8 2] "would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the"][[80 8 3] "Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one"][[80 8 4] "of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer"][[80 8 5] "convex mould of it.

Aware of their danger,"][[81 11 4] "they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind,"][[81 11 5] "rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness."][[81 11 6] "They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great"][[81 11 7] "wide parchment upon the sea."][[81 12 1] "Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,"][[81 12 2] "humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as"][[81 12 3] "by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted"][[81 12 4] "with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.

But though boats have"][[81 30 13] "been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it"][[81 30 14] "is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from"][[81 30 15] "the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising"][[81 30 16] "again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril"][[81 30 17] "of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the"][[81 30 18] "best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken"][[81 30 19] "whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the"][[81 30 20] "enormous surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than"][[81 30 21] "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense. We all know"][[81 30 22] "what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even"][[81 30 23] "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,"][[81 30 24] "bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at"][[81 30 25] "least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated"][[81 30 26] "it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns,"][[81 30 27] "and stores, and men on board."][[81 31 1] "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down"][[81 31 2] "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any"][[81 31 3] "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;"][[81 31 4] "what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and"][[81 31 5] "placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in"][[81 31 6] "agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows."][[81 31 7] "Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan"][[81 31 8] "was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and"][[81 31 9] "to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was"][[81 31 10] "once so triumphantly said--\"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?"][[81 31 11] "or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot"][[81 31 12] "hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as"][[81 31 13] "straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;"][[81 31 14] "he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\" This the creature? this he? Oh!"][[81 31 15] "that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength"][[81 31 16] "of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the"][[81 31 17] "mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!"][[81 32 1] "In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats"][[81 32 2] "sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad"][[81 32 3] "enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the"][[81 32 4] "wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!"][[81 33 1] "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly"][[81 33 2] "vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by"][[81 33 3] "magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every"][[81 33 4] "oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part"][[81 33 5] "from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce"][[81 33 6] "upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are"][[81 33 7] "scared from it into the sea."][[81 34 1] "\"Haul in! Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he's rising.\""][[81 35 1] "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth"][[81 35 2] "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all"][[81 35 3] "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two"][[81 35 4] "ship's lengths of the hunters."][[81 36 1] "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals"][[81 36 2] "there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby"][[81 36 3] "when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in"][[81 36 4] "certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities"][[81 36 5] "it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so"][[81 36 6] "that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly"][[81 36 7] "drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is"][[81 36 8] "heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance"][[81 36 9] "below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant"][[81 36 10] "streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant"][[81 36 11] "and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and"][[81 36 12] "bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will"][[81 36 13] "flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible"][[81 36 14] "hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously"][[81 36 15] "drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,"][[81 36 16] "they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept"][[81 36 17] "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only"][[81 36 18] "at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the"][[81 36 19] "air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him"][[81 36 20] "had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was"][[81 36 21] "untouched."][[81 37 1] "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of"][[81 37 2] "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly"][[81 37 3] "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were"][[81 37 4] "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the"][[81 37 5] "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes"][[81 37 6] "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see."][[81 37 7] "But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his"][[81 37 8] "blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the"][[81 37 9] "gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the"][[81 37 10] "solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all."][[81 37 11] "Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely"][[81 37 12] "discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the"][[81 37 13] "flank."][[81 38 1] "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\""][[81 39 1] "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\""][[81 40 1] "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an"][[81 40 2] "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than"][[81 40 3] "sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury"][[81 40 4] "blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews"][[81 40 5] "all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the"][[81 40 6] "bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by"][[81 40 7] "loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had"][[81 40 8] "made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,"][[81 40 9] "then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up"][[81 40 10] "the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most"][[81 40 11] "piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water"][[81 40 12] "is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled"][[81 40 13] "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the"][[81 40 14] "ground--so the last long dying spout of the whale."][[81 41 1] "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body"][[81 41 2] "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,"][[81 41 3] "by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so"][[81 41 4] "that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a"][[81 41 5] "few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when"][[81 41 6] "the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was"][[81 41 7] "strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain"][[81 41 8] "that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the"][[81 41 9] "bottom."][[81 42 1] "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,"][[81 42 2] "the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,"][[81 42 3] "on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of"][[81 42 4] "harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,"][[81 42 5] "with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any"][[81 42 6] "kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been"][[81 42 7] "some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for"][[81 42 8] "the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a"][[81 42 9] "lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,"][[81 42 10] "the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And"][[81 42 11] "when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before"][[81 42 12] "America was discovered."][[81 43 1] "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous"][[81 43 2] "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further"][[81 43 3] "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways"][[81 43 4] "to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink."][[81 43 5] "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the"][[81 43 6] "last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship"][[81 43 7] "would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the"][[81 43 8] "body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was"][[81 43 9] "the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and"][[81 43 10] "cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime"][[81 43 11] "everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the"][[81 43 12] "deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship"][[81 43 13] "groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and"][[81 43 14] "cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation."][[81 43 15] "In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable"][[81 43 16] "fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low"][[81 43 17] "had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all"][[81 43 18] "approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to"][[81 43 19] "the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over."][[81 44 1] "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in such"][[81 44 2] "a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go"][[81 44 3] "for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run"][[81 44 4] "one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.\""][[81 45 1] "\"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy"][[81 45 2] "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing"][[81 45 3] "at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were"][[81 45 4] "given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific"][[81 45 5] "snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank."][[81 46 1] "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm"][[81 46 2] "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately"][[81 46 3] "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great"][[81 46 4] "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the"][[81 46 5] "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and"][[81 46 6] "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their"][[81 46 7] "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that"][[81 46 8] "this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so"][[81 46 9] "sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it"][[81 46 10] "is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with"][[81 46 11] "noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of"][[81 46 12] "life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant"][[81 46 13] "heroes do sometimes sink."][[81 47 1] "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this"][[81 47 2] "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty"][[81 47 3] "Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in"][[81 47 4] "no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;"][[81 47 5] "his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this"][[81 47 6] "incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances"][[81 47 7] "where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale"][[81 47 8] "again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this"][[81 47 9] "is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious"][[81 47 10] "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could"][[81 47 11] "hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among"][[81 47 12] "the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they"][[81 47 13] "fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone"][[81 47 14] "down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again."][[81 48 1] "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from"][[81 48 2] "the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering"][[81 48 3] "her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,"][[81 48 4] "belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its"][[81 48 5] "incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is so"][[81 48 6] "similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is often"][[81 48 7] "mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in"][[81 48 8] "valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail,"][[81 48 9] "made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to"][[81 48 10] "leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase."][[81 49 1] "Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend."][[82 0 0] "CHAPTER 82. The Honour and Glory of Whaling."][[82 2 1] "There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true"][[82 2 2] "method."][[82 3 1] "The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up"][[82 3 2] "to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its"][[82 3 3] "great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many"][[82 3 4] "great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other"][[82 3 5] "have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection"][[82 3 6] "that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a"][[82 3 7] "fraternity."][[82 4 1] "The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and"][[82 4 2] "to the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale"][[82 4 3] "attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those"][[82 4 4] "were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to"][[82 4 5] "succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders. Every one"][[82 4 6] "knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda,"][[82 4 7] "the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as"][[82 4 8] "Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince"][[82 4 9] "of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered"][[82 4 10] "and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely"][[82 4 11] "achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this"][[82 4 12] "Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this"][[82 4 13] "Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast,"][[82 4 14] "in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton"][[82 4 15] "of a whale, which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to"][[82 4 16] "be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans"][[82 4 17] "took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What"][[82 4 18] "seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this:"][[82 4 19] "it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail."][[82 5 1] "Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some supposed"][[82 5 2] "to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of St. George and"][[82 5 3] "the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many"][[82 5 4] "old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and"][[82 5 5] "often stand for each other. \"Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a"][[82 5 6] "dragon of the sea,\" saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale;"][[82 5 7] "in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it"][[82 5 8] "would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but"][[82 5 9] "encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle"][[82 5 10] "with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a"][[82 5 11] "Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly"][[82 5 12] "up to a whale."][[82 6 1] "Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though"][[82 6 2] "the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely"][[82 6 3] "represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted"][[82 6 4] "on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance"][[82 6 5] "of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;"][[82 6 6] "and considering that as in Perseus' case, St. George's whale might have"][[82 6 7] "crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal"][[82 6 8] "ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;"][[82 6 9] "bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible"][[82 6 10] "with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to"][[82 6 11] "hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In"][[82 6 12] "fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will"][[82 6 13] "fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by"][[82 6 14] "name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and"][[82 6 15] "both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or"][[82 6 16] "fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even"][[82 6 17] "a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we"][[82 6 18] "harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order"][[82 6 19] "of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable"][[82 6 20] "company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a"][[82 6 21] "whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with"][[82 6 22] "disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are"][[82 6 23] "much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they."][[82 7 1] "Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long"][[82 7 2] "remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that"][[82 7 3] "antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good"][[82 7 4] "deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether"][[82 7 5] "that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere"][[82 7 6] "appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed,"][[82 7 7] "from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary"][[82 7 8] "whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I"][[82 7 9] "claim him for one of our clan."][[82 8 1] "But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of"][[82 8 2] "Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more"][[82 8 3] "ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly"][[82 8 4] "they are very similar. If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?"][[82 9 1] "Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole"][[82 9 2] "roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal"][[82 9 3] "kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing"][[82 9 4] "short of the great gods themselves.

But then there were some sceptical Greeks"][[83 2 4] "and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,"][[83 2 5] "equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the"][[83 2 6] "dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those"][[83 2 7] "traditions one whit the less facts, for all that."][[83 3 1] "One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew"][[83 3 2] "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,"][[83 3 3] "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented"][[83 3 4] "Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true"][[83 3 5] "with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the"][[83 3 6] "varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this"][[83 3 7] "saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his swallow is so very small."][[83 3 8] "But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not"][[83 3 9] "necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the"][[83 3 10] "whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And"][[83 3 11] "this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the"][[83 3 12] "Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and"][[83 3 13] "comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have"][[83 3 14] "ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right"][[83 3 15] "Whale is toothless."][[83 4 1] "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his"][[83 4 2] "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in"][[83 4 3] "reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices. But"][[83 4 4] "this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist"][[83 4 5] "supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a"][[83 4 6] "DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned"][[83 4 7] "their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has"][[83 4 8] "been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was"][[83 4 9] "thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape"][[83 4 10] "to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;"][[83 4 11] "and, I would add, possibly called \"The Whale,\" as some craft are"][[83 4 12] "nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have there"][[83 4 13] "been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned"][[83 4 14] "in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag"][[83 4 15] "of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a"][[83 4 16] "watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But"][[83 4 17] "he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I"][[83 4 18] "remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean"][[83 4 19] "Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'"][[83 4 20] "journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three"][[83 4 21] "days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast."][[83 4 22] "How is that?"][[83 5 1] "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that"][[83 5 2] "short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the"][[83 5 3] "way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through"][[83 5 4] "the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the"][[83 5 5] "Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete"][[83 5 6] "circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris"][[83 5 7] "waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to"][[83 5 8] "swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope"][[83 5 9] "at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great"][[83 5 10] "headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make"][[83 5 11] "modern history a liar."][[83 6 1] "But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his"][[83 6 2] "foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing"][[83 6 3] "that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the"][[83 6 4] "sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and"][[83 6 5] "abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a"][[83 6 6] "Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh"][[83 6 7] "via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of"][[83 6 8] "the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly"][[83 6 9] "enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And"][[83 6 10] "some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris's Voyages,"][[83 6 11] "speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was"][[83 6 12] "a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil."][[84 0 0] "CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling."][[84 2 1] "To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are"][[84 2 2] "anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an"][[84 2 3] "analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it"][[84 2 4] "to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly"][[84 2 5] "be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are"][[84 2 6] "hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to"][[84 2 7] "make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing"][[84 2 8] "his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau"][[84 2 9] "disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling"][[84 2 10] "under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the"][[84 2 11] "unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from"][[84 2 12] "the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some"][[84 2 13] "particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event."][[84 3 1] "Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to"][[84 3 2] "them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,"][[84 3 3] "as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium."][[84 4 1] "Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost. By great"][[84 4 2] "exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the"][[84 4 3] "stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal"][[84 4 4] "flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the"][[84 4 5] "planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became"][[84 4 6] "imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But"][[84 4 7] "to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and"][[84 4 8] "furious. What then remained?"][[84 5 1] "Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and"][[84 5 2] "countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,"][[84 5 3] "none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small"][[84 5 4] "sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It"][[84 5 5] "is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand"][[84 5 6] "fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is"][[84 5 7] "accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme"][[84 5 8] "headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve"][[84 5 9] "feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,"][[84 5 10] "and also of a lighter material--pine. It is furnished with a small rope"][[84 5 11] "called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to"][[84 5 12] "the hand after darting."][[84 6 1] "But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though"][[84 6 2] "the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it"][[84 6 3] "is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,"][[84 6 4] "on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as"][[84 6 5] "compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a"][[84 6 6] "general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any"][[84 6 7] "pitchpoling comes into play."][[84 7 1] "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and"][[84 7 2] "equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel"][[84 7 3] "in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the"][[84 7 4] "flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead."][[84 7 5] "Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its"][[84 7 6] "length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up"][[84 7 7] "the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his"][[84 7 8] "grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before"][[84 7 9] "his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering"][[84 7 10] "him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby"][[84 7 11] "elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his"][[84 7 12] "palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,"][[84 7 13] "balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless"][[84 7 14] "impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming"][[84 7 15] "distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of"][[84 7 16] "sparkling water, he now spouts red blood."][[84 8 1] "\"That drove the spigot out of him!\" cried Stubb. \"'Tis July's immortal"][[84 8 2] "Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old"][[84 8 3] "Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,"][[84 8 4] "Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we'd drink"][[84 8 5] "round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew choice punch in the"][[84 8 6] "spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the"][[84 8 7] "living stuff.\""][[84 9 1] "Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,"][[84 9 2] "the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful"][[84 9 3] "leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is"][[84 9 4] "slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and"][[84 9 5] "mutely watches the monster die."][[85 0 0] "CHAPTER 85. The Fountain."][[85 2 1] "That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of ages"][[85 2 2] "before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,"][[85 2 3] "and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so"][[85 2 4] "many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,"][[85 2 5] "thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the"][[85 2 6] "whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this should"][[85 2 7] "be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter"][[85 2 8] "minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D."][[85 2 9] "), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings"][[85 2 10] "are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is surely a"][[85 2 11] "noteworthy thing."][[85 3 1] "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items"][[85 3 2] "contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their"][[85 3 3] "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is"][[85 3 4] "combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod"][[85 3 5] "might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface."][[85 3 6] "But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular"][[85 3 7] "lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the"][[85 3 8] "disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for"][[85 3 9] "his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree"][[85 3 10] "breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm"][[85 3 11] "Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and"][[85 3 12] "what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he"][[85 3 13] "breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head."][[85 4 1] "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function"][[85 4 2] "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a"][[85 4 3] "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the"][[85 4 4] "blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I"][[85 4 5] "shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words."][[85 4 6] "Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be"][[85 4 7] "aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not"][[85 4 8] "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then"][[85 4 9] "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the"][[85 4 10] "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full"][[85 4 11] "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or"][[85 4 12] "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has"][[85 4 13] "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine"][[85 4 14] "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of"][[85 4 15] "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are"][[85 4 16] "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more,"][[85 4 17] "a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in"][[85 4 18] "him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus"][[85 4 19] "supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs."][[85 4 20] "The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the"][[85 4 21] "supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more"][[85 4 22] "cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of"][[85 4 23] "that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase"][[85 4 24] "it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the"][[85 4 25] "Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform"][[85 4 26] "with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and"][[85 4 27] "jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he"][[85 4 28] "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to"][[85 4 29] "a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that"][[85 4 30] "he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular"][[85 4 31] "allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he"][[85 4 32] "finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that"][[85 4 33] "in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one"][[85 4 34] "they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his"][[85 4 35] "spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere"][[85 4 36] "descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the"][[85 4 37] "whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For"][[85 4 38] "not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing"][[85 4 39] "a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O"][[85 4 40] "hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!"][[85 5 1] "In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving"][[85 5 2] "for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to"][[85 5 3] "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the"][[85 5 4] "Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time."][[85 6 1] "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if"][[85 6 2] "it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then"][[85 6 3] "I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell"][[85 6 4] "seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all"][[85 6 5] "answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged"][[85 6 6] "with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of"][[85 6 7] "smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or"][[85 6 8] "whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on"][[85 6 9] "this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper"][[85 6 10] "olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no"][[85 6 11] "Cologne-water in the sea."][[85 7 1] "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting"][[85 7 2] "canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is furnished"][[85 7 3] "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of"][[85 7 4] "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;"][[85 7 5] "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,"][[85 7 6] "he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?"][[85 7 7] "Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to"][[85 7 8] "this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a"][[85 7 9] "living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!"][[85 8 1] "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it"][[85 8 2] "is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,"][[85 8 3] "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little"][[85 8 4] "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down"][[85 8 5] "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this"][[85 8 6] "gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the"][[85 8 7] "Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that"][[85 8 8] "exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and"][[85 8 9] "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly"][[85 8 10] "communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this"][[85 8 11] "is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because"][[85 8 12] "the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he"][[85 8 13] "accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath"][[85 8 14] "the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if"][[85 8 15] "you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find"][[85 8 16] "that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods"][[85 8 17] "of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration."][[85 9 1] "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!"][[85 9 2] "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not"][[85 9 3] "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to"][[85 9 4] "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the"][[85 9 5] "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in"][[85 9 6] "it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely."][[85 10 1] "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping"][[85 10 2] "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,"][[85 10 3] "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view"][[85 10 4] "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading"][[85 10 5] "all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really"][[85 10 6] "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are"][[85 10 7] "not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they"][[85 10 8] "are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole"][[85 10 9] "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head? For"][[85 10 10] "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with"][[85 10 11] "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then,"][[85 10 12] "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under"][[85 10 13] "a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with"][[85 10 14] "rain."][[85 11 1] "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the"][[85 11 2] "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering"][[85 11 3] "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to"][[85 11 4] "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into"][[85 11 5] "slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will"][[85 11 6] "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of"][[85 11 7] "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer"][[85 11 8] "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,"][[85 11 9] "or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm."][[85 11 10] "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to"][[85 11 11] "evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt"][[85 11 12] "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you."][[85 11 13] "The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let"][[85 11 14] "this deadly spout alone."][[85 12 1] "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My"][[85 12 2] "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides"][[85 12 3] "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations"][[85 12 4] "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;"][[85 12 5] "I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed"][[85 12 6] "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other"][[85 12 7] "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am"][[85 12 8] "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as"][[85 12 9] "Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes"][[85 12 10] "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep"][[85 12 11] "thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the"][[85 12 12] "curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,"][[85 12 13] "a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my"][[85 12 14] "head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,"][[85 12 15] "after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;"][[85 12 16] "this seems an additional argument for the above supposition."][[85 13 1] "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to"][[85 13 2] "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild"][[85 13 3] "head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable"][[85 13 4] "contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes see it--glorified"][[85 13 5] "by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts."][[85 13 6] "For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate"][[85 13 7] "vapour. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my"][[85 13 8] "mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a"][[85 13 9] "heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;"][[85 13 10] "but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.

The Tail."][[86 2 1] "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,"][[86 2 2] "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I"][[86 2 3] "celebrate a tail."][[86 3 1] "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of"][[86 3 2] "the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises"][[86 3 3] "upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The"][[86 3 4] "compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms"][[86 3 5] "or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness."][[86 3 6] "At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways"][[86 3 7] "recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In"][[86 3 8] "no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in"][[86 3 9] "the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the"][[86 3 10] "full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across."][[86 4 1] "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut"][[86 4 2] "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,"][[86 4 3] "middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are"][[86 4 4] "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running"][[86 4 5] "crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as"][[86 4 6] "anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman"][[86 4 7] "walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin"][[86 4 8] "course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful"][[86 4 9] "relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the"][[86 4 10] "great strength of the masonry."][[86 5 1] "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,"][[86 5 2] "the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of"][[86 5 3] "muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins"][[86 5 4] "and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and"][[86 5 5] "largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent"][[86 5 6] "measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point."][[86 5 7] "Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it."][[86 6 1] "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful"][[86 6 2] "flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through"][[86 6 3] "a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most"][[86 6 4] "appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony,"][[86 6 5] "but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,"][[86 6 6] "strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that"][[86 6 7] "all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its"][[86 6 8] "charm would be gone.

Therein no"][[86 7 4] "fairy's arm can transcend it."][[86 8 1] "Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for"][[86 8 2] "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;"][[86 8 3] "Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes."][[86 9 1] "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in"][[86 9 2] "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never"][[86 9 3] "wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the"][[86 9 4] "whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled"][[86 9 5] "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this"][[86 9 6] "which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when"][[86 9 7] "furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by."][[86 10 1] "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only"][[86 10 2] "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his"][[86 10 3] "conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In"][[86 10 4] "striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the"][[86 10 5] "blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed"][[86 10 6] "air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply"][[86 10 7] "irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only"][[86 10 8] "salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the"][[86 10 9] "opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale"][[86 10 10] "boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed"][[86 10 11] "plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most"][[86 10 12] "serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the"][[86 10 13] "fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off"][[86 10 14] "a frock, and the hole is stopped."][[86 11 1] "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale"][[86 11 2] "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect"][[86 11 3] "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the"][[86 11 4] "elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of"][[86 11 5] "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft"][[86 11 6] "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface"][[86 11 7] "of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,"][[86 11 8] "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!"][[86 11 9] "Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of"][[86 11 10] "Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with"][[86 11 11] "low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their"][[86 11 12] "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not"][[86 11 13] "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet"][[86 11 14] "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk"][[86 11 15] "and extracted the dart."][[86 12 1] "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the"][[86 12 2] "middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence"][[86 12 3] "of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a"][[86 12 4] "hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of"][[86 12 5] "his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the"][[86 12 6] "thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great"][[86 12 7] "gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour"][[86 12 8] "from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was"][[86 12 9] "the smoke from the touch-hole."][[86 13 1] "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes"][[86 13 2] "lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely"][[86 13 3] "out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into"][[86 13 4] "the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are"][[86 13 5] "tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they"][[86 13 6] "downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime BREACH--somewhere"][[86 13 7] "else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the"][[86 13 8] "grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless"][[86 13 9] "profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the"][[86 13 10] "highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth"][[86 13 11] "his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in"][[86 13 12] "gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in"][[86 13 13] "the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the"][[86 13 14] "archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that"][[86 13 15] "crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,"][[86 13 16] "all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with"][[86 13 17] "peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment"][[86 13 18] "of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of"][[86 13 19] "the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African"][[86 13 20] "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout"][[86 13 21] "of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of"][[86 13 22] "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the"][[86 13 23] "profoundest silence."][[86 14 1] "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the"][[86 14 2] "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk"][[86 14 3] "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two"][[86 14 4] "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they"][[86 14 5] "respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier"][[86 14 6] "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the"][[86 14 7] "stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as"][[86 14 8] "the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash"][[86 14 9] "of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have"][[86 14 10] "one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews"][[86 14 11] "into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*"][[86 16 1] "*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale"][[86 16 2] "and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the"][[86 16 3] "elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to"][[86 16 4] "the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious"][[86 16 5] "similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant"][[86 16 6] "will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,"][[86 16 7] "jet it forth in a stream."][[86 18 1] "The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability"][[86 18 2] "to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they"][[86 18 3] "would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an"][[86 18 4] "extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,"][[86 18 5] "that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason"][[86 18 6] "signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods"][[86 18 7] "intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other"][[86 18 8] "motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and"][[86 18 9] "unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,"][[86 18 10] "then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know"][[86 18 11] "not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more,"][[86 18 12] "how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back"][[86 18 13] "parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I"][[86 18 14] "cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will about"][[86 18 15] "his face, I say again he has no face."][[87 0 0] "CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada."][[87 2 1] "The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from"][[87 2 2] "the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia."][[87 2 3] "In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of"][[87 2 4] "Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a"][[87 2 5] "vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia,"][[87 2 6] "and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded"][[87 2 7] "oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports"][[87 2 8] "for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the"][[87 2 9] "straits of Sunda and Malacca.

The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied"][[87 3 11] "with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the"][[87 3 12] "Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis.

But"][[87 15 10] "no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm"][[87 15 11] "Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,--though"][[87 15 12] "as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming"][[87 15 13] "in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like"][[87 15 14] "flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity."][[87 16 1] "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and"][[87 16 2] "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,"][[87 16 3] "when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating"][[87 16 4] "token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange"][[87 16 5] "perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive"][[87 16 6] "it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns"][[87 16 7] "in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now"][[87 16 8] "broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the"][[87 16 9] "Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation."][[87 16 10] "In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly"][[87 16 11] "swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they"][[87 16 12] "plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more"][[87 16 13] "strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed"][[87 16 14] "as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the"][[87 16 15] "sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over"][[87 16 16] "the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced"][[87 16 17] "such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic"][[87 16 18] "of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of"][[87 16 19] "thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a"][[87 16 20] "solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded"][[87 16 21] "together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the"][[87 16 22] "slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,"][[87 16 23] "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,"][[87 16 24] "therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales"][[87 16 25] "before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not"][[87 16 26] "infinitely outdone by the madness of men."][[87 17 1] "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,"][[87 17 2] "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor"][[87 17 3] "retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in"][[87 17 4] "those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one"][[87 17 5] "lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes' time,"][[87 17 6] "Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray"][[87 17 7] "in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight"][[87 17 8] "for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the"][[87 17 9] "whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and"][[87 17 10] "indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present"][[87 17 11] "one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift"][[87 17 12] "monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid"][[87 17 13] "adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb."][[87 18 1] "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of"][[87 18 2] "speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we"][[87 18 3] "thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by"][[87 18 4] "the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was"][[87 18 5] "like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer"][[87 18 6] "through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what"][[87 18 7] "moment it may be locked in and crushed."][[87 19 1] "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off"][[87 19 2] "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away"][[87 19 3] "from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the"][[87 19 4] "time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our"][[87 19 5] "way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time"][[87 19 6] "to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted"][[87 19 7] "duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the"][[87 19 8] "shouting part of the business. \"Out of the way, Commodore!\" cried one,"][[87 19 9] "to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,"][[87 19 10] "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \"Hard down with your tail,"][[87 19 11] "there!\" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed"][[87 19 12] "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity."][[87 20 1] "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented"][[87 20 2] "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood"][[87 20 3] "of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each"][[87 20 4] "other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then"][[87 20 5] "attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line"][[87 20 6] "being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly"][[87 20 7] "among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales"][[87 20 8] "are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm"][[87 20 9] "whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must"][[87 20 10] "kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing"][[87 20 11] "them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it"][[87 20 12] "is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat"][[87 20 13] "was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully"][[87 20 14] "darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the"][[87 20 15] "enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like"][[87 20 16] "malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the"][[87 20 17] "act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one"][[87 20 18] "of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it"][[87 20 19] "away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from"][[87 20 20] "under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we"][[87 20 21] "stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for"][[87 20 22] "the time."][[87 21 1] "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were"][[87 21 2] "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly"][[87 21 3] "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the"][[87 21 4] "circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that"][[87 21 5] "when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways"][[87 21 6] "vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we"][[87 21 7] "glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if"][[87 21 8] "from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here"][[87 21 9] "the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard"][[87 21 10] "but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth"][[87 21 11] "satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture"][[87 21 12] "thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now"][[87 21 13] "in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every"][[87 21 14] "commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of"][[87 21 15] "the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight"][[87 21 16] "or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of"][[87 21 17] "horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic"][[87 21 18] "circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have"][[87 21 19] "gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing"][[87 21 20] "whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no"][[87 21 21] "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for"][[87 21 22] "a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only"][[87 21 23] "admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,"][[87 21 24] "we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women"][[87 21 25] "and children of this routed host."][[87 22 1] "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving"][[87 22 2] "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in"][[87 22 3] "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by"][[87 22 4] "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square"][[87 22 5] "miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be"][[87 22 6] "deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that"][[87 22 7] "seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this"][[87 22 8] "circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely"][[87 22 9] "locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the"][[87 22 10] "herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its"][[87 22 11] "stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way"][[87 22 12] "innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller"][[87 22 13] "whales--now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the"][[87 22 14] "lake--evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still"][[87 22 15] "becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household"][[87 22 16] "dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and"][[87 22 17] "touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly"][[87 22 18] "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched"][[87 22 19] "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the"][[87 22 20] "time refrained from darting it."][[87 23 1] "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still"][[87 23 2] "stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended"][[87 23 3] "in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the"][[87 23 4] "whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to"][[87 23 5] "become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth"][[87 23 6] "exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly"][[87 23 7] "and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different"][[87 23 8] "lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still"][[87 23 9] "spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the"][[87 23 10] "young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if"][[87 23 11] "we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their"][[87 23 12] "sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little"][[87 23 13] "infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might"][[87 23 14] "have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in"][[87 23 15] "girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet"][[87 23 16] "recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the"][[87 23 17] "maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final"][[87 23 18] "spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate"][[87 23 19] "side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the"][[87 23 20] "plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign"][[87 23 21] "parts."][[87 24 1] "\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast! him"][[87 24 2] "fast!--Who line him! Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one little!\""][[87 25 1] "\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck."][[87 26 1] "\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down."][[87 27 1] "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of"][[87 27 2] "fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows"][[87 27 3] "the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the"][[87 27 4] "air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame"][[87 27 5] "Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not"][[87 27 6] "seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with"][[87 27 7] "the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that"][[87 27 8] "the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas"][[87 27 9] "seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan"][[87 27 10] "amours in the deep.*"][[87 29 1] "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike"][[87 29 2] "most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation"][[87 29 3] "which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a"][[87 29 4] "time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and"][[87 29 5] "Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously"][[87 29 6] "situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves"][[87 29 7] "extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a"][[87 29 8] "nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk"][[87 29 9] "and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet"][[87 29 10] "and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries."][[87 29 11] "When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM."][[87 31 1] "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations"][[87 31 2] "and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and"][[87 31 3] "fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled"][[87 31 4] "in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of"][[87 31 5] "my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and"][[87 31 6] "while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and"][[87 31 7] "deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy."][[87 32 1] "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic"][[87 32 2] "spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,"][[87 32 3] "still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or"][[87 32 4] "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of"][[87 32 5] "room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight"][[87 32 6] "of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro"][[87 32 7] "across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is"][[87 32 8] "sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful"][[87 32 9] "and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or"][[87 32 10] "maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled"][[87 32 11] "cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again."][[87 32 12] "A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not"][[87 32 13] "effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along"][[87 32 14] "with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of"][[87 32 15] "the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone"][[87 32 16] "mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay"][[87 32 17] "wherever he went."][[87 33 1] "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle"][[87 33 2] "enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to"][[87 33 3] "inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the"][[87 33 4] "intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that"][[87 33 5] "by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had"][[87 33 6] "become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run"][[87 33 7] "away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope"][[87 33 8] "attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the"][[87 33 9] "harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose"][[87 33 10] "from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning"][[87 33 11] "through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and"][[87 33 12] "tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own"][[87 33 13] "comrades."][[87 34 1] "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their"][[87 34 2] "stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake"][[87 34 3] "began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted"][[87 34 4] "by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to"][[87 34 5] "heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;"][[87 34 6] "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central"][[87 34 7] "circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was"][[87 34 8] "departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the"][[87 34 9] "tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in"][[87 34 10] "Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,"][[87 34 11] "as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck"][[87 34 12] "and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern."][[87 35 1] "\"Oars! Oars!\" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--\"gripe your"][[87 35 2] "oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,"][[87 35 3] "you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him! Stand up--stand"][[87 35 4] "up, and stay so! Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their backs--scrape"][[87 35 5] "them!--scrape away!\""][[87 36 1] "The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a"][[87 36 2] "narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor"][[87 36 3] "we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly,"][[87 36 4] "and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many"][[87 36 5] "similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had"][[87 36 6] "just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales,"][[87 36 7] "all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply"][[87 36 8] "purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows"][[87 36 9] "to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by"][[87 36 10] "the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close"][[87 36 11] "by."][[87 37 1] "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon"][[87 37 2] "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having"][[87 37 3] "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their"][[87 37 4] "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but"][[87 37 5] "the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales"][[87 37 6] "might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had"][[87 37 7] "killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which"][[87 37 8] "are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand,"][[87 37 9] "are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to"][[87 37 10] "mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should"][[87 37 11] "the boats of any other ship draw near."][[87 38 1] "The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious"][[87 38 2] "saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish. Of all the"][[87 38 3] "drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for"][[87 38 4] "the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other"][[87 38 5] "craft than the Pequod."][[88 0 0] "CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters."][[88 2 1] "The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm"][[88 2 2] "Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those"][[88 2 3] "vast aggregations."][[88 3 1] "Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must"][[88 3 2] "have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are"][[88 3 3] "occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each."][[88 3 4] "Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those"][[88 3 5] "composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young"][[88 3 6] "vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated."][[88 4 1] "In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a"][[88 4 2] "male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces"][[88 4 3] "his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his"][[88 4 4] "ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about"][[88 4 5] "over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces"][[88 4 6] "and endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and"][[88 4 7] "his concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest"][[88 4 8] "leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not"][[88 4 9] "more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are"][[88 4 10] "comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen"][[88 4 11] "yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the"][[88 4 12] "whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT."][[88 5 1] "It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent"][[88 5 2] "ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely"][[88 5 3] "search of variety.

But"][[89 9 7] "others are by no means so scrupulous."][[89 10 1] "Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated"][[89 10 2] "in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of"][[89 10 3] "a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had"][[89 10 4] "succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of"][[89 10 5] "their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat"][[89 10 6] "itself.

Wherefore the"][[89 10 13] "plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,"][[89 10 14] "harpoons, and boat."][[89 11 1] "Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was"][[89 11 2] "the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on"][[89 11 3] "to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con."][[89 11 4] "case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's"][[89 11 5] "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in"][[89 11 6] "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to"][[89 11 7] "recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he"][[89 11 8] "then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally"][[89 11 9] "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the"][[89 11 10] "great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet"][[89 11 11] "abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore"][[89 11 12] "when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that"][[89 11 13] "subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have"][[89 11 14] "been found sticking in her."][[89 12 1] "Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale"][[89 12 2] "and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other."][[89 13 1] "These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very"][[89 13 2] "learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the boat, he"][[89 13 3] "awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it"][[89 13 4] "to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,"][[89 13 5] "harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because"][[89 13 6] "it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons"][[89 13 7] "and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)"][[89 13 8] "acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards"][[89 13 9] "took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took"][[89 13 10] "the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs."][[89 14 1] "A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might"][[89 14 2] "possibly object to it.

As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from"][[91 6 4] "his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and"][[91 6 5] "hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside"][[91 6 6] "must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that"][[91 6 7] "has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse."][[91 6 8] "It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must"][[91 6 9] "exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are"][[91 6 10] "incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded"][[91 6 11] "by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it."][[91 6 12] "Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that"][[91 6 13] "the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and"][[91 6 14] "by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose."][[91 7 1] "Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman"][[91 7 2] "had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more"][[91 7 3] "of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of"][[91 7 4] "those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort"][[91 7 5] "of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies"][[91 7 6] "almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the"][[91 7 7] "proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn"][[91 7 8] "up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted"][[91 7 9] "whales in general."][[91 8 1] "The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed"][[91 8 2] "he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were"][[91 8 3] "knotted round the tail of one of these whales."][[91 9 1] "\"There's a pretty fellow, now,\" he banteringly laughed, standing in the"][[91 9 2] "ship's bows, \"there's a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes"][[91 9 3] "of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering"][[91 9 4] "their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,"][[91 9 5] "and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of"][[91 9 6] "tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they"][[91 9 7] "will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's wick into; aye, we all"][[91 9 8] "know these things; but look ye, here's a Crappo that is content with our"][[91 9 9] "leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with"][[91 9 10] "scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor"][[91 9 11] "devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make him a present"][[91 9 12] "of a little oil for dear charity's sake. For what oil he'll get from"][[91 9 13] "that drugged whale there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not"][[91 9 14] "in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get"][[91 9 15] "more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than"][[91 9 16] "he'll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it"][[91 9 17] "may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris."][[91 9 18] "I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It's worth trying. Yes,"][[91 9 19] "I'm for it;\" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck."][[91 10 1] "By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether"][[91 10 2] "or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of"][[91 10 3] "escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb"][[91 10 4] "now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing"][[91 10 5] "across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French"][[91 10 6] "taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a"][[91 10 7] "huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper"][[91 10 8] "spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a"][[91 10 9] "symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in"][[91 10 10] "large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton de Rose,\"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud;"][[91 10 11] "and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship."][[91 11 1] "Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription, yet"][[91 11 2] "the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently"][[91 11 3] "explained the whole to him."][[91 12 1] "\"A wooden rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that will"][[91 12 2] "do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\""][[91 13 1] "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he"][[91 13 2] "had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to"][[91 13 3] "the blasted whale; and so talk over it."][[91 14 1] "Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he"][[91 14 2] "bawled--\"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that"][[91 14 3] "speak English?\""][[91 15 1] "\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be"][[91 15 2] "the chief-mate."][[91 16 1] "\"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\""][[91 17 1] "\"WHAT whale?\""][[91 18 1] "\"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?"][[91 19 1] "\"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale--no.\""][[91 20 1] "\"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute.\""][[91 21 1] "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning"][[91 21 2] "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands"][[91 21 3] "into a trumpet and shouted--\"No, Sir! No!\" Upon which Ahab retired, and"][[91 21 4] "Stubb returned to the Frenchman."][[91 22 1] "He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the"][[91 22 2] "chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of"][[91 22 3] "bag."][[91 23 1] "\"What's the matter with your nose, there?\" said Stubb. \"Broke it?\""][[91 24 1] "\"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!\" answered"][[91 24 2] "the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very"][[91 24 3] "much. \"But what are you holding YOURS for?\""][[91 25 1] "\"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it?"][[91 25 2] "Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,"][[91 25 3] "Bouton-de-Rose?\""][[91 26 1] "\"What in the devil's name do you want here?\" roared the Guernseyman,"][[91 26 2] "flying into a sudden passion."][[91 27 1] "\"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those"][[91 27 2] "whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do"][[91 27 3] "you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of"][[91 27 4] "such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his"][[91 27 5] "whole carcase.\""][[91 28 1] "\"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe"][[91 28 2] "it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But"][[91 28 3] "come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll"][[91 28 4] "get out of this dirty scrape.\""][[91 29 1] "\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined Stubb,"][[91 29 2] "and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented"][[91 29 3] "itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the"][[91 29 4] "heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow"][[91 29 5] "and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their"][[91 29 6] "noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms."][[91 29 7] "Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the"][[91 29 8] "mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the"][[91 29 9] "plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their"][[91 29 10] "nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short"][[91 29 11] "off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it"][[91 29 12] "constantly filled their olfactories."][[91 30 1] "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from"][[91 30 2] "the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a"][[91 30 3] "fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within."][[91 30 4] "This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating"][[91 30 5] "against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain's"][[91 30 6] "round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could"][[91 30 7] "not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times."][[91 31 1] "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the"][[91 31 2] "Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate"][[91 31 3] "expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,"][[91 31 4] "who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle."][[91 31 5] "Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man"][[91 31 6] "had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore"][[91 31 7] "held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and"][[91 31 8] "confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan"][[91 31 9] "for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all"][[91 31 10] "dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan"][[91 31 11] "of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was"][[91 31 12] "to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as"][[91 31 13] "for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in"][[91 31 14] "him during the interview."][[91 32 1] "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a"][[91 32 2] "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with"][[91 32 3] "large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest"][[91 32 4] "with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely"][[91 32 5] "introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the"][[91 32 6] "aspect of interpreting between them."][[91 33 1] "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he."][[91 34 1] "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \"you"][[91 34 2] "may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,"][[91 34 3] "though I don't pretend to be a judge.\""][[91 35 1] "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his"][[91 35 2] "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain"][[91 35 3] "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a"][[91 35 4] "blasted whale they had brought alongside.\""][[91 36 1] "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more."][[91 37 1] "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb."][[91 38 1] "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him"][[91 38 2] "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a"][[91 38 3] "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a"][[91 38 4] "baboon.\""][[91 39 1] "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is"][[91 39 2] "far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,"][[91 39 3] "as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\""][[91 40 1] "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his"][[91 40 2] "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose"][[91 40 3] "the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship."][[91 41 1] "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to"][[91 41 2] "them."][[91 42 1] "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in"][[91 42 2] "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody"][[91 42 3] "else.\""][[91 43 1] "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to"][[91 43 2] "us.\""][[91 44 1] "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties"][[91 44 2] "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his"][[91 44 3] "cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux."][[91 45 1] "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the interpreter."][[91 46 1] "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink"][[91 46 2] "with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\""][[91 47 1] "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but"][[91 47 2] "that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had"][[91 47 3] "best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for"][[91 47 4] "it's so calm they won't drift.\""][[91 48 1] "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed"][[91 48 2] "the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his"][[91 48 3] "boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter"][[91 48 4] "whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats,"][[91 48 5] "then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed"][[91 48 6] "away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most"][[91 48 7] "unusually long tow-line."][[91 49 1] "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;"][[91 49 2] "hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the"][[91 49 3] "Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly"][[91 49 4] "pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of"][[91 49 5] "his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous"][[91 49 6] "cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the"][[91 49 7] "body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was"][[91 49 8] "digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck"][[91 49 9] "against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and"][[91 49 10] "pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew were all in high"][[91 49 11] "excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as"][[91 49 12] "gold-hunters."][[91 50 1] "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and"][[91 50 2] "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning"][[91 50 3] "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when"][[91 50 4] "suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint"][[91 50 5] "stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without"][[91 50 6] "being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with"][[91 50 7] "another, without at all blending with it for a time."][[91 51 1] "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in"][[91 51 2] "the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\""][[91 52 1] "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls"][[91 52 2] "of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old"][[91 52 3] "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with"][[91 52 4] "your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good"][[91 52 5] "friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist."][[91 52 6] "Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the"][[91 52 7] "sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for"][[91 52 8] "impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board,"][[91 52 9] "else the ship would bid them good bye."][[92 0 0] "CHAPTER 92. Ambergris."][[92 2 1] "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as"][[92 2 2] "an article of commerce, that in  a certain Nantucket-born Captain"][[92 2 3] "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that"][[92 2 4] "subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,"][[92 2 5] "the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem"][[92 2 6] "to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for"][[92 2 7] "grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though"][[92 2 8] "at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland"][[92 2 9] "soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,"][[92 2 10] "amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for"][[92 2 11] "mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,"][[92 2 12] "waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in"][[92 2 13] "perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum."][[92 2 14] "The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same"][[92 2 15] "purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine"][[92 2 16] "merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it."][[92 3 1] "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale"][[92 3 2] "themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick"][[92 3 3] "whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and"][[92 3 4] "by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such"][[92 3 5] "a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four"][[92 3 6] "boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as"][[92 3 7] "laborers do in blasting rocks."][[92 4 1] "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain"][[92 4 2] "hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors'"][[92 4 3] "trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing"][[92 4 4] "more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner."][[92 5 1] "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be"][[92 5 2] "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that"][[92 5 3] "saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;"][[92 5 4] "how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise"][[92 5 5] "call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh"][[92 5 6] "the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of"][[92 5 7] "ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the"][[92 5 8] "worst."][[92 6 1] "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,"][[92 6 2] "owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen,"][[92 6 3] "and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be"][[92 6 4] "considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of"][[92 6 5] "the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous"][[92 6 6] "aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout"][[92 6 7] "a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They"][[92 6 8] "hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma"][[92 6 9] "originate?"][[92 7 1] "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the"][[92 7 2] "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because"][[92 7 3] "those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as"][[92 7 4] "the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in"][[92 7 5] "small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry"][[92 7 6] "it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas,"][[92 7 7] "and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding"][[92 7 8] "any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,"][[92 7 9] "and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a"][[92 7 10] "savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an"][[92 7 11] "old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital."][[92 8 1] "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be"][[92 8 2] "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former"][[92 8 3] "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which"][[92 8 4] "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great"][[92 8 5] "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,"][[92 8 6] "fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a"][[92 8 7] "place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without"][[92 8 8] "being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of"][[92 8 9] "furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full"][[92 8 10] "operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is"][[92 8 11] "quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four"][[92 8 12] "years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,"][[92 8 13] "perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the"][[92 8 14] "state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that"][[92 8 15] "living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by"][[92 8 16] "no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the"][[92 8 17] "people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by"][[92 8 18] "the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,"][[92 8 19] "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance"][[92 8 20] "of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the"][[92 8 21] "open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water"][[92 8 22] "dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a"][[92 8 23] "warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance,"][[92 8 24] "considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with"][[92 8 25] "jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian"][[92 8 26] "town to do honour to Alexander the Great?"][[93 0 0] "CHAPTER 93. The Castaway."][[93 2 1] "It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most"][[93 2 2] "significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew; an"][[93 2 3] "event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes"][[93 2 4] "madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying"][[93 2 5] "prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own."][[93 3 1] "Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.

It"][[93 3 7] "was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by"][[93 3 8] "abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember"][[93 3 9] "his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly."][[93 4 1] "In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a"][[93 4 2] "white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in"][[93 4 3] "one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and"][[93 4 4] "torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom"][[93 4 5] "very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to"][[93 4 6] "his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with"][[93 4 7] "finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year's calendar"][[93 4 8] "should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and"][[93 4 9] "New Year's Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was"][[93 4 10] "brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous"][[93 4 11] "ebony, panelled in king's cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life's"][[93 4 12] "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he"][[93 4 13] "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his"][[93 4 14] "brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily"][[93 4 15] "subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by"][[93 4 16] "strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the"][[93 4 17] "natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut,"][[93 4 18] "he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green; and at"][[93 4 19] "melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon"][[93 4 20] "into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day,"][[93 4 21] "suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop"][[93 4 22] "will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you"][[93 4 23] "the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy"][[93 4 24] "ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural"][[93 4 25] "gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then"][[93 4 26] "the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies,"][[93 4 27] "looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to"][[93 4 28] "the story."][[93 5 1] "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman"][[93 5 2] "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;"][[93 5 3] "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place."][[93 6 1] "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;"][[93 6 2] "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and"][[93 6 3] "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing"][[93 6 4] "him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness"][[93 6 5] "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful."][[93 7 1] "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as"][[93 7 2] "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which"][[93 7 3] "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The"][[93 7 4] "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in"][[93 7 5] "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale"][[93 7 6] "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as"][[93 7 7] "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That"][[93 7 8] "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly"][[93 7 9] "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks"][[93 7 10] "of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken"][[93 7 11] "several turns around his chest and neck."][[93 8 1] "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He"][[93 8 2] "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,"][[93 8 3] "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,"][[93 8 4] "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\" Meantime Pip's blue, choked face"][[93 8 5] "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less than"][[93 8 6] "half a minute, this entire thing happened."][[93 9 1] "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was"][[93 9 2] "saved."][[93 10 1] "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed"][[93 10 2] "by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these"][[93 10 3] "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,"][[93 10 4] "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,"][[93 10 5] "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never"][[93 10 6] "jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the"][[93 10 7] "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, STICK TO THE BOAT, is your"][[93 10 8] "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM"][[93 10 9] "THE BOAT, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he"][[93 10 10] "should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving"][[93 10 11] "him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped"][[93 10 12] "all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat,"][[93 10 13] "Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We"][[93 10 14] "can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for"][[93 10 15] "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and"][[93 10 16] "don't jump any more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that"][[93 10 17] "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which"][[93 10 18] "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence."][[93 11 1] "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was"][[93 11 2] "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time"][[93 11 3] "he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to"][[93 11 4] "run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk."][[93 11 5] "Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous,"][[93 11 6] "blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,"][[93 11 7] "all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the"][[93 11 8] "extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed"][[93 11 9] "like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly"][[93 11 10] "astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was"][[93 11 11] "winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between"][[93 11 12] "Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his"][[93 11 13] "crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though"][[93 11 14] "the loftiest and the brightest."][[93 12 1] "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the"][[93 12 2] "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful"][[93 12 3] "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the"][[93 12 4] "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how"][[93 12 5] "when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark how closely they"][[93 12 6] "hug their ship and only coast along her sides."][[93 13 1] "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he"][[93 13 2] "did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,"][[93 13 3] "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very"][[93 13 4] "quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards"][[93 13 5] "oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested"][[93 13 6] "by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not"][[93 13 7] "unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so"][[93 13 8] "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to"][[93 13 9] "military navies and armies."][[93 14 1] "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly"][[93 14 2] "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and"][[93 14 3] "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent"][[93 14 4] "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him"][[93 14 5] "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but"][[93 14 6] "from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at"][[93 14 7] "least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body"][[93 14 8] "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though."][[93 14 9] "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of"][[93 14 10] "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;"][[93 14 11] "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the"][[93 14 12] "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,"][[93 14 13] "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters"][[93 14 14] "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the"][[93 14 15] "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's"][[93 14 16] "insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man"][[93 14 17] "comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and"][[93 14 18] "frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his"][[93 14 19] "God."][[93 15 1] "For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that"][[93 15 2] "fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what"][[93 15 3] "like abandonment befell myself."][[94 0 0] "CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand."][[94 2 1] "That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to"][[94 2 2] "the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations"][[94 2 3] "previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of"][[94 2 4] "the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case."][[94 3 1] "While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed"][[94 3 2] "in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and"][[94 3 3] "when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated"][[94 3 4] "ere going to the try-works, of which anon."][[94 4 1] "It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several"][[94 4 2] "others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I found"][[94 4 3] "it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the"][[94 4 4] "liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid."][[94 4 5] "A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was"][[94 4 6] "such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a"][[94 4 7] "softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for"][[94 4 8] "only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to"][[94 4 9] "serpentine and spiralise."][[94 5 1] "As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter"][[94 5 2] "exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under"][[94 5 3] "indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among"][[94 5 4] "those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within"][[94 5 5] "the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their"][[94 5 6] "opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that"][[94 5 7] "uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like the smell of spring"][[94 5 8] "violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky"][[94 5 9] "meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible"][[94 5 10] "sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit"][[94 5 11] "the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying"][[94 5 12] "the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from"][[94 5 13] "all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever."][[94 6 1] "Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm"][[94 6 2] "till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a"][[94 6 3] "strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly"][[94 6 4] "squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the"][[94 6 5] "gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving"][[94 6 6] "feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually"][[94 6 7] "squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as"][[94 6 8] "much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish"][[94 6 9] "any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;"][[94 6 10] "let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into"][[94 6 11] "each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and"][[94 6 12] "sperm of kindness."][[94 7 1] "Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by"][[94 7 2] "many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases"][[94 7 3] "man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable"][[94 7 4] "felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in"][[94 7 5] "the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the"][[94 7 6] "country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case"][[94 7 7] "eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of"][[94 7 8] "angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti."][[94 8 1] "Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things"][[94 8 2] "akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the"][[94 8 3] "try-works."][[94 9 1] "First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering"][[94 9 2] "part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It"][[94 9 3] "is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but still contains"][[94 9 4] "some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first"][[94 9 5] "cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like"][[94 9 6] "blocks of Berkshire marble."][[94 10 1] "Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the"][[94 10 2] "whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and"][[94 10 3] "often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is"][[94 10 4] "a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name"][[94 10 5] "imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked"][[94 10 6] "snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and"][[94 10 7] "purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,"][[94 10 8] "it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole"][[94 10 9] "behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive"][[94 10 10] "a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted,"][[94 10 11] "supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison"][[94 10 12] "season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an"][[94 10 13] "unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne."][[94 11 1] "There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in"][[94 11 2] "the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling"][[94 11 3] "adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation"][[94 11 4] "original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance."][[94 11 5] "It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the"][[94 11 6] "tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting."][[94 11 7] "I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,"][[94 11 8] "coalescing."][[94 12 1] "Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but"][[94 12 2] "sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the"][[94 12 3] "dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland"][[94 12 4] "or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior"][[94 12 5] "souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan."][[94 13 1] "Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary."][[94 13 2] "But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman's nipper is"][[94 13 3] "a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of"][[94 13 4] "Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is"][[94 13 5] "about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the"][[94 13 6] "oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless"][[94 13 7] "blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities."][[94 14 1] "But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once"][[94 14 2] "to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates."][[94 14 3] "This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the"][[94 14 4] "blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.

On one side, lit by a dull"][[94 14 7] "lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally"][[94 14 8] "go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is"][[94 14 9] "similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is"][[94 14 10] "something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a"][[94 14 11] "sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship"][[94 14 12] "pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet"][[94 14 13] "itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This"][[94 14 14] "spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan's feet are shoeless;"][[94 14 15] "the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from"][[94 14 16] "him, like a sledge.

It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,"][[96 3 18] "with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first"][[96 3 19] "indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies"][[96 3 20] "gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from"][[96 3 21] "any point in precisely the same time."][[96 4 1] "Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare"][[96 4 2] "masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of"][[96 4 3] "the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted"][[96 4 4] "with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented"][[96 4 5] "from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir"][[96 4 6] "extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel"][[96 4 7] "inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as"][[96 4 8] "fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct"][[96 4 9] "from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment."][[96 5 1] "It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were"][[96 5 2] "first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee"][[96 5 3] "the business."][[96 6 1] "\"All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the"][[96 6 2] "works.\" This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his"][[96 6 3] "shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that"][[96 6 4] "in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a"][[96 6 5] "time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick"][[96 6 6] "ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the"][[96 6 7] "crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains"][[96 6 8] "considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames."][[96 6 9] "Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once"][[96 6 10] "ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body."][[96 6 11] "Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to"][[96 6 12] "inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in"][[96 6 13] "it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such"][[96 6 14] "as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left"][[96 6 15] "wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit."][[96 7 1] "By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the"][[96 7 2] "carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean"][[96 7 3] "darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce"][[96 7 4] "flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and"][[96 7 5] "illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek"][[96 7 6] "fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to"][[96 7 7] "some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the"][[96 7 8] "bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad"][[96 7 9] "sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and"][[96 7 10] "folded them in conflagrations."][[96 8 1] "The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth"][[96 8 2] "in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the"][[96 8 3] "pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers. With huge pronged"][[96 8 4] "poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or"][[96 8 5] "stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out"][[96 8 6] "of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen"][[96 8 7] "heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil,"][[96 8 8] "which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth"][[96 8 9] "of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the"][[96 8 10] "windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not"][[96 8 11] "otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their"][[96 8 12] "eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all"][[96 8 13] "begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting"][[96 8 14] "barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in"][[96 8 15] "the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other"][[96 8 16] "their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth;"][[96 8 17] "as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the"][[96 8 18] "flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers"][[96 8 19] "wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the"][[96 8 20] "wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and"][[96 8 21] "yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness"][[96 8 22] "of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in"][[96 8 23] "her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing"][[96 8 24] "Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning"][[96 8 25] "a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the"][[96 8 26] "material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul."][[96 9 1] "So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently"][[96 9 2] "guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,"][[96 9 3] "in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the"][[96 9 4] "ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before"][[96 9 5] "me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred"][[96 9 6] "visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable"][[96 9 7] "drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm."][[96 10 1] "But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)"][[96 10 2] "thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was"][[96 10 3] "horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote"][[96 10 4] "my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails,"][[96 10 5] "just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I"][[96 10 6] "was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically"][[96 10 7] "stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see"][[96 10 8] "no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I"][[96 10 9] "had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it."][[96 10 10] "Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by"][[96 10 11] "flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift,"][[96 10 12] "rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as"][[96 10 13] "rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of"][[96 10 14] "death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with"][[96 10 15] "the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,"][[96 10 16] "inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief"][[96 10 17] "sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's stern, with"][[96 10 18] "my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just"][[96 10 19] "in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very"][[96 10 20] "probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this"][[96 10 21] "unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being"][[96 10 22] "brought by the lee!"][[96 11 1] "Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy"][[96 11 2] "hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first"][[96 11 3] "hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its"][[96 11 4] "redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,"][[96 11 5] "the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking"][[96 11 6] "flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the"][[96 11 7] "glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp--all others but liars!"][[96 12 1] "Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's"][[96 12 2] "accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of"][[96 12 3] "deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,"][[96 12 4] "which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this"][[96 12 5] "earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow"][[96 12 6] "in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or undeveloped. With"][[96 12 7] "books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the"][[96 12 8] "truest of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered"][[96 12 9] "steel of woe. \"All is vanity.\" ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold"][[96 12 10] "of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and"][[96 12 11] "jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of"][[96 12 12] "operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all"][[96 12 13] "of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as"][[96 12 14] "passing wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit"][[96 12 15] "down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably"][[96 12 16] "wondrous Solomon."][[96 13 1] "But even Solomon, he says, \"the man that wandereth out of the way"][[96 13 2] "of understanding shall remain\" (I.E., even while living) \"in the"][[96 13 3] "congregation of the dead.\" Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it"][[96 13 4] "invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom"][[96 13 5] "that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill"][[96 13 6] "eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges,"][[96 13 7] "and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces."][[96 13 8] "And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the"][[96 13 9] "mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still"][[96 13 10] "higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar."][[97 0 0] "CHAPTER 97.

To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in"][[97 3 3] "darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he"][[97 3 4] "seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an"][[97 3 5] "Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night"][[97 3 6] "the ship's black hull still houses an illumination."][[97 4 1] "See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of"][[97 4 2] "lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler at"][[97 4 3] "the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat.

It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He"][[97 4 7] "goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and"][[97 4 8] "genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own"][[97 4 9] "supper of game."][[98 0 0] "CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up."][[98 2 1] "Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off"][[98 2 2] "descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and"][[98 2 3] "slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside"][[98 2 4] "and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of"][[98 2 5] "old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded"][[98 2 6] "surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he"][[98 2 7] "is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his"][[98 2 8] "spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;--but now it"][[98 2 9] "remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by"][[98 2 10] "rehearsing--singing, if I may--the romantic proceeding of decanting off"][[98 2 11] "his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where"][[98 2 12] "once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along"][[98 2 13] "beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow."][[98 3 1] "While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the"][[98 3 2] "six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling"][[98 3 3] "this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed"][[98 3 4] "round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot"][[98 3 5] "across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last"][[98 3 6] "man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,"][[98 3 7] "rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX OFFICIO,"][[98 3 8] "every sailor is a cooper."][[98 4 1] "At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great"][[98 4 2] "hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down"][[98 4 3] "go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are"][[98 4 4] "replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up."][[98 5 1] "In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable"][[98 5 2] "incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with"][[98 5 3] "freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of"][[98 5 4] "the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as"][[98 5 5] "in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the"][[98 5 6] "bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire"][[98 5 7] "ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is"][[98 5 8] "deafening."][[98 6 1] "But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this"][[98 6 2] "self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,"][[98 6 3] "you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a"][[98 6 4] "most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses"][[98 6 5] "a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never"][[98 6 6] "look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides,"][[98 6 7] "from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is"][[98 6 8] "readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale"][[98 6 9] "remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands"][[98 6 10] "go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags"][[98 6 11] "restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower"][[98 6 12] "rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise"][[98 6 13] "faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed"][[98 6 14] "upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of"][[98 6 15] "sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined"][[98 6 16] "and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company, the"][[98 6 17] "whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew"][[98 6 18] "themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to"][[98 6 19] "toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as"][[98 6 20] "bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland."][[98 7 1] "Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and"][[98 7 2] "humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;"][[98 7 3] "propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not"][[98 7 4] "to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to"][[98 7 5] "such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short"][[98 7 6] "of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to.

Yes, and we flipped it"][[101 5 10] "at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it's"][[101 5 11] "squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were"][[101 5 12] "called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each"][[101 5 13] "other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our"][[101 5 14] "jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the"][[101 5 15] "howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts"][[101 5 16] "did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we"][[101 5 17] "had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down"][[101 5 18] "the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my"][[101 5 19] "taste."][[101 6 1] "The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.

For, as a general thing, the English"][[101 8 5] "merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in"][[101 8 6] "the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,"][[101 8 7] "but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special"][[101 8 8] "origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated."][[101 9 1] "During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an"][[101 9 2] "ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I"][[101 9 3] "knew must be about whalers. The title was, \"Dan Coopman,\" wherefore I"][[101 9 4] "concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam"][[101 9 5] "cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was"][[101 9 6] "reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one"][[101 9 7] "\"Fitz Swackhammer.\" But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,"][[101 9 8] "professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and"][[101 9 9] "St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box"][[101 9 10] "of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he"][[101 9 11] "spied the book, assured me that \"Dan Coopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper,\""][[101 9 12] "but \"The Merchant.\" In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book"][[101 9 13] "treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained"][[101 9 14] "a very interesting account of its whale fishery.

Now, as those"][[101 13 2] "polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that"][[101 13 3] "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,"][[101 13 4] "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much"][[101 13 5] "exceed three months, say, and reckoning  men to each of their fleet"][[101 13 6] "of  sail, we have , Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,"][[101 13 7] "we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks'"][[101 13 8] "allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that  ankers of gin."][[101 13 9] "Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might"][[101 13 10] "fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in"][[101 13 11] "a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem"][[101 13 12] "somewhat improbable.

Think you I let that chance go, without using my"][[102 4 7] "boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the"][[102 4 8] "contents of that young cub?"][[102 5 1] "And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their"][[102 5 2] "gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted"][[102 5 3] "to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides."][[102 5 4] "For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey"][[102 5 5] "of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with"][[102 5 6] "the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side"][[102 5 7] "glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his"][[102 5 8] "capital."][[102 6 1] "Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted"][[102 6 2] "with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought"][[102 6 3] "together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his"][[102 6 4] "people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,"][[102 6 5] "chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;"][[102 6 6] "and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the"][[102 6 7] "wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores."][[102 7 1] "Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an"][[102 7 2] "unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his"][[102 7 3] "head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings"][[102 7 4] "seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of"][[102 7 5] "its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,"][[102 7 6] "then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a"][[102 7 7] "grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it."][[102 8 1] "The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with"][[102 8 2] "Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests"][[102 8 3] "kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head"][[102 8 4] "again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a bough, the"][[102 8 5] "terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung"][[102 8 6] "sword that so affrighted Damocles."][[102 9 1] "It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy"][[102 9 2] "Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the"][[102 9 3] "industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous carpet"][[102 9 4] "on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and"][[102 9 5] "the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden"][[102 9 6] "branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying"][[102 9 7] "air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the"][[102 9 8] "leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied"][[102 9 9] "verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither"][[102 9 10] "flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless"][[102 9 11] "toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but one single word with"][[102 9 12] "thee! Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float from forth the loom; the"][[102 9 13] "freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves;"][[102 9 14] "and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and"][[102 9 15] "by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only"][[102 9 16] "when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through"][[102 9 17] "it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that"][[102 9 18] "are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly"][[102 9 19] "heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby"][[102 9 20] "have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in"][[102 9 21] "all this din of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be"][[102 9 22] "overheard afar."][[102 10 1] "Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the"][[102 10 2] "great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler! Yet,"][[102 10 3] "as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around"][[102 10 4] "him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven"][[102 10 5] "over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but"][[102 10 6] "himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim"][[102 10 7] "god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories."][[102 11 1] "Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the"][[102 11 2] "skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real"][[102 11 3] "jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as"][[102 11 4] "an object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests"][[102 11 5] "should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced"][[102 11 6] "before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through the"][[102 11 7] "ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid"][[102 11 8] "its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was"][[102 11 9] "out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered."][[102 11 10] "I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones."][[102 12 1] "Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton."][[102 12 2] "From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the"][[102 12 3] "altitude of the final rib, \"How now!\" they shouted; \"Dar'st thou measure"][[102 12 4] "this our god! That's for us.\" \"Aye, priests--well, how long do ye make"][[102 12 5] "him, then?\" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning"][[102 12 6] "feet and inches; they cracked each other's sconces with their"][[102 12 7] "yard-sticks--the great skull echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I"][[102 12 8] "quickly concluded my own admeasurements."][[102 13 1] "These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be"][[102 13 2] "it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied"][[102 13 3] "measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can"][[102 13 4] "refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell"][[102 13 5] "me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where"][[102 13 6] "they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I"][[102 13 7] "have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have"][[102 13 8] "what the proprietors call \"the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or"][[102 13 9] "River Whale in the United States.\" Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire,"][[102 13 10] "England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has"][[102 13 11] "in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size,"][[102 13 12] "by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's."][[102 14 1] "In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons"][[102 14 2] "belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar"][[102 14 3] "grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir"][[102 14 4] "Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir"][[102 14 5] "Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a"][[102 14 6] "great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony"][[102 14 7] "cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day"][[102 14 8] "upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and"][[102 14 9] "shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of"][[102 14 10] "keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at"][[102 14 11] "the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo"][[102 14 12] "in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view"][[102 14 13] "from his forehead."][[102 15 1] "The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied"][[102 15 2] "verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild"][[102 15 3] "wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving"][[102 15 4] "such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished"][[102 15 5] "the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was"][[102 15 6] "then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might remain--I did not"][[102 15 7] "trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all"][[102 15 8] "enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale."][[103 0 0] "CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton."][[103 2 1] "In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain"][[103 2 2] "statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we"][[103 2 3] "are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here."][[103 3 1] "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base"][[103 3 2] "upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest"][[103 3 3] "sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful"][[103 3 4] "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between"][[103 3 5] "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty"][[103 3 6] "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least"][[103 3 7] "ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would"][[103 3 8] "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one"][[103 3 9] "thousand one hundred inhabitants."][[103 4 1] "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this"][[103 4 2] "leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?"][[103 5 1] "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,"][[103 5 2] "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now"][[103 5 3] "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his"][[103 5 4] "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large"][[103 5 5] "a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the"][[103 5 6] "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in"][[103 5 7] "this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your"][[103 5 8] "arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the"][[103 5 9] "general structure we are about to view."][[103 6 1] "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two"][[103 6 2] "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have"][[103 6 3] "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one"][[103 6 4] "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,"][[103 6 5] "his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of"][[103 6 6] "plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a"][[103 6 7] "third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once"][[103 6 8] "enclosed his vitals."][[103 7 1] "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,"][[103 7 2] "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled"][[103 7 3] "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty"][[103 7 4] "of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the"][[103 7 5] "time, but a long, disconnected timber."][[103 8 1] "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,"][[103 8 2] "was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each"][[103 8 3] "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one"][[103 8 4] "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From"][[103 8 5] "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only"][[103 8 6] "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore"][[103 8 7] "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most"][[103 8 8] "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay"][[103 8 9] "footpath bridges over small streams."][[103 9 1] "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the"][[103 9 2] "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of"][[103 9 3] "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of"][[103 9 4] "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish"][[103 9 5] "which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the"][[103 9 6] "invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen"][[103 9 7] "feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight"][[103 9 8] "feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the"][[103 9 9] "living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw"][[103 9 10] "but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of"][[103 9 11] "added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the"][[103 9 12] "ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the"][[103 9 13] "weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!"][[103 10 1] "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try"][[103 10 2] "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead"][[103 10 3] "attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the"][[103 10 4] "heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry"][[103 10 5] "flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale"][[103 10 6] "be truly and livingly found out."][[103 11 1] "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a"][[103 11 2] "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now"][[103 11 3] "it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar."][[103 12 1] "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are"][[103 12 2] "not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on"][[103 12 3] "a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,"][[103 12 4] "a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth"][[103 12 5] "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the"][[103 12 6] "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white"][[103 12 7] "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they"][[103 12 8] "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest's children,"][[103 12 9] "who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the"][[103 12 10] "spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple"][[103 12 11] "child's play."][[104 0 0] "CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale."][[104 2 1] "From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon"][[104 2 2] "to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not"][[104 2 3] "compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial"][[104 2 4] "folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail,"][[104 2 5] "and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic"][[104 2 6] "involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great"][[104 2 7] "cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a"][[104 2 8] "line-of-battle-ship."][[104 3 1] "Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me"][[104 3 2] "to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not"][[104 3 3] "overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him"][[104 3 4] "out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him"][[104 3 5] "in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it"][[104 3 6] "now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and"][[104 3 7] "antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the"][[104 3 8] "Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be deemed"][[104 3 9] "unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is"][[104 3 10] "altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest"][[104 3 11] "words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been"][[104 3 12] "convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have"][[104 3 13] "invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased"][[104 3 14] "for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal"][[104 3 15] "bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author"][[104 3 16] "like me."][[104 4 1] "One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,"][[104 4 2] "though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing"][[104 4 3] "of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard"][[104 4 4] "capitals. Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an"][[104 4 5] "inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my"][[104 4 6] "thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their"][[104 4 7] "outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole"][[104 4 8] "circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and"][[104 4 9] "mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas"][[104 4 10] "of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its"][[104 4 11] "suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal"][[104 4 12] "theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose"][[104 4 13] "a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the"][[104 4 14] "flea, though many there be who have tried it."][[104 5 1] "Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials"][[104 5 2] "as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been"][[104 5 3] "a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,"][[104 5 4] "wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of"][[104 5 5] "preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier"][[104 5 6] "geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost"][[104 5 7] "completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called"][[104 5 8] "the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted"][[104 5 9] "links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote"][[104 5 10] "posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales"][[104 5 11] "hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last"][[104 5 12] "preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them"][[104 5 13] "precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet"][[104 5 14] "sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking"][[104 5 15] "rank as Cetacean fossils."][[104 6 1] "Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones"][[104 6 2] "and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been"][[104 6 3] "found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in"][[104 6 4] "Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama."][[104 6 5] "Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the"][[104 6 6] "year  was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street"][[104 6 7] "opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones"][[104 6 8] "disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's"][[104 6 9] "time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly"][[104 6 10] "unknown Leviathanic species."][[104 7 1] "But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost"][[104 7 2] "complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year , on"][[104 7 3] "the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous"][[104 7 4] "slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen"][[104 7 5] "angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed"][[104 7 6] "upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being"][[104 7 7] "taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out"][[104 7 8] "that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A"][[104 7 9] "significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this"][[104 7 10] "book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the"][[104 7 11] "shape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster"][[104 7 12] "Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society,"][[104 7 13] "pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures"][[104 7 14] "which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence."][[104 8 1] "When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,"][[104 8 2] "jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to"][[104 8 3] "the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on"][[104 8 4] "the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical"][[104 8 5] "Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back"][[104 8 6] "to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;"][[104 8 7] "for time began with man. Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and I"][[104 8 8] "obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged"][[104 8 9] "bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in"][[104 8 10] "all the , miles of this world's circumference, not an inhabitable"][[104 8 11] "hand's breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the"][[104 8 12] "whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines"][[104 8 13] "of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan?"][[104 8 14] "Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh's. Methuselah seems"][[104 8 15] "a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem.

To trail the"][[106 4 20] "genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the"][[106 4 21] "sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the"][[106 4 22] "glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must"][[106 4 23] "needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad."][[106 4 24] "The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of"][[106 4 25] "sorrow in the signers."][[106 5 1] "Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more"][[106 5 2] "properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.

So that, through their zeal for him, they had"][[106 5 18] "all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of"][[106 5 19] "this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable"][[106 5 20] "interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod's decks."][[106 6 1] "But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,"][[106 6 2] "or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not"][[106 6 3] "with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain"][[106 6 4] "practical procedures;--he called the carpenter."][[106 7 1] "And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay"][[106 7 2] "set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied"][[106 7 3] "with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus"][[106 7 4] "far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection"][[106 7 5] "of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.

Yet was this half-horrible"][[107 6 13] "stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying"][[107 6 14] "heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,"][[107 6 15] "crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now"][[107 6 16] "and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served"][[107 6 17] "to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle"][[107 6 18] "of Noah's ark.

He was a stript abstract; an"][[107 6 22] "unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without"][[107 6 23] "premeditated reference to this world or the next.

But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones"][[110 5 12] "grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller;"][[110 5 13] "they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply"][[110 5 14] "looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that"][[110 5 15] "immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like"][[110 5 16] "circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes"][[110 5 17] "seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that"][[110 5 18] "cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this"][[110 5 19] "waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who"][[110 5 20] "were bystanders when Zoroaster died.

At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they"][[130 6 13] "stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by"][[130 6 14] "the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the"][[130 6 15] "Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned"][[130 6 16] "substance."][[130 7 1] "And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,"][[130 7 2] "and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab"][[130 7 3] "seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.

But if"][[130 9 6] "these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally"][[130 9 7] "expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them."][[130 10 1] "\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\"--he said. \"Aye!"][[130 10 2] "Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest"][[130 10 3] "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved"][[130 10 4] "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the"][[130 10 5] "downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for"][[130 10 6] "the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that"][[130 10 7] "end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon"][[130 10 8] "his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon"][[130 10 9] "Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his"][[130 10 10] "firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,--\"Take the rope, sir--I give"][[130 10 11] "it into thy hands, Starbuck.\" Then arranging his person in the basket,"][[130 10 12] "he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being"][[130 10 13] "the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And"][[130 10 14] "thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad"][[130 10 15] "upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and"][[130 10 16] "that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height."][[130 11 1] "When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in"][[130 11 2] "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is"][[130 11 3] "hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these"][[130 11 4] "circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge"][[130 11 5] "to some one man who has the special watch of it.

Ahab had now gained his final"][[133 10 4] "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just"][[133 10 5] "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's"][[133 10 6] "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale"][[133 10 7] "was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing"][[133 10 8] "his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the"][[133 10 9] "air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had"][[133 10 10] "so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans."][[133 11 1] "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men"][[133 11 2] "all around him."][[133 12 1] "\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I"][[133 12 2] "cried out,\" said Tashtego."][[133 13 1] "\"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate"][[133 13 2] "reserved the doubloon for me.

A pale, death-glimmer lit up"][[133 16 4] "Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth."][[133 17 1] "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;"][[133 17 2] "but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew"][[133 17 3] "still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a"][[133 17 4] "noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.

He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head"][[133 17 9] "beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went"][[133 17 10] "the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical"][[133 17 11] "rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters"][[133 17 12] "interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;"][[133 17 13] "and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But"][[133 17 14] "these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly"][[133 17 15] "feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to"][[133 17 16] "some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but"][[133 17 17] "shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;"][[133 17 18] "and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and"][[133 17 19] "to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and"][[133 17 20] "rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons."][[133 18 1] "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested"][[133 18 2] "the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with"][[133 18 3] "ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering"][[133 18 4] "eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,"][[133 18 5] "rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that"][[133 18 6] "great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so"][[133 18 7] "divinely swam."][[133 19 1] "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once"][[133 19 2] "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale"][[133 19 3] "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who"][[133 19 4] "namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured"][[133 19 5] "to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of"][[133 19 6] "tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all"][[133 19 7] "who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way"][[133 19 8] "thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before."][[133 20 1] "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among"][[133 20 2] "waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby"][[133 20 3] "Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his"][[133 20 4] "submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw."][[133 20 5] "But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant"][[133 20 6] "his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural"][[133 20 7] "Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the"][[133 20 8] "grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly"][[133 20 9] "halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered"][[133 20 10] "over the agitated pool that he left."][[133 21 1] "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the"][[133 21 2] "three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance."][[133 22 1] "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed"][[133 22 2] "beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing"][[133 22 3] "vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed"][[133 22 4] "whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now"][[133 22 5] "freshened; the sea began to swell."][[133 23 1] "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego."][[133 24 1] "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were"][[133 24 2] "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began"][[133 24 3] "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,"][[133 24 4] "expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover"][[133 24 5] "no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its"][[133 24 6] "depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white"][[133 24 7] "weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,"][[133 24 8] "till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked"][[133 24 9] "rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable"][[133 24 10] "bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,"][[133 24 11] "shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The"][[133 24 12] "glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble"][[133 24 13] "tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled"][[133 24 14] "the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon"][[133 24 15] "Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and"][[133 24 16] "seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and"][[133 24 17] "stand by to stern."][[133 25 1] "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its"][[133 25 2] "bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet"][[133 25 3] "under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that"][[133 25 4] "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,"][[133 25 5] "as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath"][[133 25 6] "the boat."][[133 26 1] "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for"][[133 26 2] "an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of"][[133 26 3] "a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his"][[133 26 4] "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into"][[133 26 5] "the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish"][[133 26 6] "pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's"][[133 26 7] "head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale"][[133 26 8] "now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With"][[133 26 9] "unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the"][[133 26 10] "tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the"][[133 26 11] "uttermost stern."][[133 27 1] "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the"][[133 27 2] "whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his"][[133 27 3] "body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from"][[133 27 4] "the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and"][[133 27 5] "while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis"][[133 27 6] "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with"][[133 27 7] "this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and"][[133 27 8] "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized"][[133 27 9] "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from"][[133 27 10] "its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the"][[133 27 11] "frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an"][[133 27 12] "enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,"][[133 27 13] "and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two"][[133 27 14] "floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew"][[133 27 15] "at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast"][[133 27 16] "to the oars to lash them across."][[133 28 1] "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first"][[133 28 2] "to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a"][[133 28 3] "movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand"][[133 28 4] "had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only"][[133 28 5] "slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over sideways as it"][[133 28 6] "slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of"][[133 28 7] "it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea."][[133 29 1] "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little"][[133 29 2] "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the"][[133 29 3] "billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;"][[133 29 4] "so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or more feet"][[133 29 5] "out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,"][[133 29 6] "dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray"][[133 29 7] "still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel"][[133 29 8] "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to"][[133 29 9] "overleap its summit with their scud."][[133 31 1] "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation"][[133 31 2] "(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down"][[133 31 3] "poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously"][[133 31 4] "described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively"][[133 31 5] "view whatever objects may be encircling him."][[133 33 1] "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round"][[133 33 2] "and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful"][[133 33 3] "wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault."][[133 33 4] "The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of"][[133 33 5] "grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants in the book"][[133 33 6] "of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's"][[133 33 7] "insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still"][[133 33 8] "keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless"][[133 33 9] "Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock"][[133 33 10] "might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and"][[133 33 11] "mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not"][[133 33 12] "succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves."][[133 33 13] "For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so"][[133 33 14] "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed"][[133 33 15] "horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed,"][[133 33 16] "still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to"][[133 33 17] "strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of"][[133 33 18] "the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they"][[133 33 19] "themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on"][[133 33 20] "the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old"][[133 33 21] "man's head."][[133 34 1] "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's"][[133 34 2] "mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;"][[133 34 3] "and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--\"Sail on"][[133 34 4] "the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and"][[133 34 5] "whelmed him for the time.

It was thus now. But"][[133 43 4] "the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,"][[133 43 5] "for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a"][[133 43 6] "velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,"][[133 43 7] "pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a"][[133 43 8] "hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an"][[133 43 9] "unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable"][[133 43 10] "only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it"][[133 43 11] "sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of"][[133 43 12] "overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were"][[133 43 13] "soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having"][[133 43 14] "been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her"][[133 43 15] "side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it"][[133 43 16] "with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the"][[133 43 17] "Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,"][[133 43 18] "methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced"][[133 43 19] "from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone"][[133 43 20] "down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch"][[133 43 21] "in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his"][[133 43 22] "voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon now?

But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling"][[134 20 14] "like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;"][[134 20 15] "though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's"][[134 20 16] "unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds."][[134 21 1] "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed"][[134 21 2] "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three"][[134 21 3] "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,"][[134 21 4] "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now"][[134 21 5] "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more"][[134 21 6] "tremendous charge.

Only one"][[134 22 4] "thing could be done.

As he saw all this; as he"][[135 40 12] "heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving"][[135 40 13] "a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or"][[135 40 14] "flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had"][[135 40 15] "just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer"][[135 40 16] "and nails, and so nail it to the mast."][[135 41 1] "Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance"][[135 41 2] "to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some"][[135 41 3] "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White"][[135 41 4] "Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly"][[135 41 5] "nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start had not been"][[135 41 6] "so long a one as before.

Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again!"][[135 54 6] "He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one,"][[135 54 7] "whose duty tells him he cannot depart.

Retribution, swift vengeance,"][[135 57 7] "eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal"][[135 57 8] "man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's"][[135 57 9] "starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their"][[135 57 10] "faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook"][[135 57 11] "on their bull-like necks.

Next instant, the"][[135 61 6] "heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty"][[135 61 7] "tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its"][[135 61 8] "depths."][[135 62 1] "For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned. \"The"][[135 62 2] "ship?

And now, concentric"][[135 62 7] "circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating"][[135 62 8] "oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all"][[135 62 9] "round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod"][[135 62 10] "out of sight."][[135 63 1] "But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the"][[135 63 2] "sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the"][[135 63 3] "erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,"][[135 63 4] "which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying"][[135 63 5] "billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm and a hammer"][[135 63 6] "hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing"][[135 63 7] "the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.
