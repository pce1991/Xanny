And histwo little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, werekickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castleand earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn onlythe nieceof-his-in-law, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled arosy one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up andfireland was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne:Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? Andthat was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour handworded hergrace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace o'malice kidsnapped up thejiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain.And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deefstop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud.And there was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling anglessomewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years' walkin Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots off thejiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers mastersfor to tauch him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesureallgood and he became a luderman. So then she started to rain and torain and, be redtom, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother's in a braceof samers and the jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, atanother time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry.And Jarl von Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in hiscellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilaryand the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet,wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankqueannipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from thehillcombs. And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark theTwy, why do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut! saysthe wicked, handwording her madesty. So her madesty aforethought setdown a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways toWoeman's Land she rain, rain, rain.

So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair ofchangers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl von Hoother's and theLarryhill with her under her abromette. And why would she halt at all ifnot by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the thirdcharm? And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to hispantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare!

And the prankquean picked ablank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling. And she made her wittestin front of the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why do I amalook alike three poss of porter pease? But that was how the skirtmishesendupped.

As if that were notto be enough for anyone but little headway, if any, was made in solvingthe wasnottobe crime cunundrum when a child of Maam, Festy King, ofa family long and honourably associated with the tar and featherindustries, who gave an address in old plomansch Mayo of the Saxonsin the heart of a foulfamed potheen district, was subsequently haled upat the Old Bailey on the calends of Mars, under an incompatibly framedindictment of both the counts (from each equinoxious points of view,the one fellow's fetch being the other follow's person) that is to see,flying cushats out of his ouveralls and making fesses immodst his forceson the field.

The gathering, convened by the Irish Angricultural andPrepostoral Ouraganisations, to help the Irish muck to look his brotherdane in the face and attended thanks to Larry by large numbers, ofchristies and jew's totems, tospite of the deluge, was distinctly of ascattery kind when the ballybricken he could get no good of, aftercockofthewalking through a few fancyfought mains ate some of thedoorweg, the pikey later selling the gentleman ratepayer because she,Francie's sister, that is to say, ate a whole side of his (the animal's) sty,on a struggle Street, Qui Sta Troia, in order to pay off, hiss or lick, sixdoubloons fifteen arrears of his, the villain's not the rumbler's rent.     Remarkable evidence was given, anon, by an eye, ear, nose andthroat witness, whom Wesleyan chapelgoers suspected of being a plainclothes priest W.P., situate at Nullnull, Medical Square, who, uponletting down his rice and peacegreen coverdisk and having been sullenlycautioned against yawning while being grilled, smiled (he had had aonebumper at parting from Mrs Molroe in the morning) and stated to hiseliciter under his morse mustaccents (gobbless!) that he slept with abonafides and that he would be there to remember the filth ofNovember, hatinaring, rowdy O, which, with the jiboulees of Juno andthe dates of ould lanxiety, was going, please the Rainmaker, to decembswithin the ephemerides of profane history, all one with Tournay,Yetstoslay and Temorah, and one thing which would pigstickularlystrike a person of such sorely tried observational powers as Sam, himand Moffat, though theirs not to reason why, the striking thing about itwas that he was patrified to see, hear, taste and smell, as his time ofnight, how Hyacinth O'Donnell, B.A., described in the calendar as amixer and wordpainter, with part of a sivispacem (Gaeltact fordungfork) on the fair green at the hour of twenty-four o'clock sought(the bullycassidy of the friedhoffer!) to sack, sock, stab and slaughtersinglehanded another two of the old kings, Gush Mac Gale and RoaringO'Crian, Jr., both changelings, unlucalised, of no address and innoncommunicables, between him and whom, ever since wallops beforethe Mise of Lewes, bad blood existed on the ground of the boer'strespass on the bull or because he firstparted his polarbeeber hair intwoways, or because they were creepfoxed andt grousuppers over anippy in a noveletta, or because they could not say meace, (mute anddaft) meathe. The litigants, he said, local congsmen and donalds, kingsof the arans and the dalkeys, kings of mud and tory, even the goat kingof Killorglin, were egged on by their supporters in the shape ofbetterwomen with bowstrung hair of Carrothagenuine ruddiness, wavingcrimson petties and screaming from Isod's towertop.

Now, patience; and remember patience is the great thing, and aboveall things else we must avoid anything like being or becoming out ofpatience. A good plan used by worried business folk who may not havehad many momentums to master Kung's doctrine of the meang or thepropriety codestruces of Carprimustimus is just to think of all thesinking fund of patience possessed in their conjoint names by bothbrothers Bruce with whom are incorporated their Scotch spider andElberfeld's Calculating Horses.

To conclude purely negatively from thepositive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its pagecannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that periodor those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclusion leaped at, beingtantamount to inferring from the nonpresence of inverted commas(sometimes called quotation marks) on any page that its author wasalways constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the spoken wordsof others.    Luckily there is another cant to the questy. Has any fellow, of thedime a dozen type, it might with some profit some dull evening quietlybe hinted -- has any usual sort of ornery josser, flatchested fortyish,faintly flatulent and given to ratiocination by syncopation in theelucidation    of    complications,    of   his   greatest   Fung     Yangdynasdescendanced, only another the son of, in fact, ever lookedsufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped addressedenvelope? Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face, in all its featurefulperfection of imperfection, is its fortune: it exhibits only the civil ormilitary clothing of whatever passionpallid nudity or plaguepurplenakedness may happen to tuck itself under its flap. Yet to concentratesolely on the literal sense or even the psychological content of anydocument to the sore neglect of the enveloping facts themselvescircumstantiating it is just as hurtful to sound sense (and let it be addedto the truest taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting anintro from another fellow turning out to be a friend in need of his, say,to a lady of the latter's acquaintance, engaged in performing theelaborative antecistral ceremony of upstheres, straightaway to run offand vision her plump and plain in her natural altogether, preferring toclose his blinkhard's eyes to the ethiquethical fact that she was, after all,wearing for the space of the time being some definite articles ofevolutionary clothing, inharmonious creations, a captious critic mightdescribe them as, or not strictly necessary or a trifle irritating here andthere, but for all that suddenly full of local colour and personal perfumeand suggestive, too, of so very much more and capable of beingstretched, filled out, if need or wish were, of having their surprisinglylike coincidental parts separated don't they now, for better survey by thedeft hand of an expert, don't you know? Who in his heart doubts eitherthat the facts of feminine clothiering are there all the time or that thefeminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same time,only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from the other? Orthat both may then be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each maybe taken up and considered in turn apart from the other?    Here let a few artifacts fend in their own favour. The river felt shewanted salt. That was just where Brien came in. The country asked forbearspaw for dindin! And boundin aboundin it got it surly.

If you met on the binge a poor acheseyeld from Ailing, when thetune of his tremble shook shimmy on shin, while his countrary raged inthe weak of his wailing, like a rugilant pugilant Lyon O'Lynn; if hemaundered in misliness, plaining hisplight or, played fox and lice,pricking and dropping hips teeth, or wringing his handcuffs for peace,the blind blighter, praying Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinksto eath; if he weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, madecold blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, kakeor kick with a suck, sigh or simper, a diffle to larn and a dibble to lech;if the fain shinner pegged you to shave his immartial, wee skillmusteredshoul with his ooh, hoodoodoo! broking wind that to wiles, woemaid sinhe was partial, we don't think, Jones, we'd care to this evening, wouldyou?    Answer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did theytell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had awag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life isnot natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this beggingquestion it would be far fitter for you, if you dare! to hasitate to consultwith and consequentially attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cashproblem elsewhere naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of soeminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my forthe first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven asunder by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcashcharacktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fierygoodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure wehave had our little recherch� brush with, what, Schott?) and as I furthercould have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. behaviouristically paillet�with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chanceridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where's hairs theorics of Winestain.To put it all the more plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate.Whilst the quality and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean bythis with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequentsentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gatesmay be.    Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out aquantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising state of affairs).A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you beenseeing much of Talisand Talis those times? optimately meaning: Will you put up at hree ofirish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised as you temptoed her �la sourdine: Of your plates? Is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, whois on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funkyou! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At arecent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronicspinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of formwas trying his seesers, Dr's Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why'swhich Suchman's talis qualis? to whom, as a fatter of macht, DrGedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted:While thou beast' one zoom of a whorl! (Talis and Talis originally meanthe same thing, hit it's: Qualis.)    Professor Loewy-Brueller (though as I shall promptly prove hiswhole account of the Sennacherib as distinct from the Shalmanesirsanitational reforms and of the Mr Skekels and Dr Hydes problem in thesame connection differs toto coelo from the fruit of my owninvestigations -- though the reason I went to Jericho must remain forcertain reasons a political secret -- especially as I shall shortly bewanted in Cavantry, I congratulate myself, for the same and otherreasons -- as being again hopelessly vitiated by what I have nowresolved to call the dime and cash diamond fallacy) in his talked offconfession which recently met with such a leonine uproar on its escapeafter its confinement Why am I not born like a Gentileman and why am Inow so speakable about my own eatables (Feigenbaumblatt and Father,Judapest, 5688, A.M.) whole-heartedly takes off his gabbercoat andwig, honest draughty fellow, in his public interest, to make us see howthough, as he says: 'by Allswill' the inception and the descent and theendswell of Man is temporarily wrapped in obscenity, looking throughat these accidents with the faroscope of television, (this nightlifeinstrument needs still some subtractional betterment in the readjustmentof the more refrangible angles to the squeals of his hypothesis on theouter tin sides), I can easily believe heartily in my own most spaciousimmensityas my ownhouse and microbemost cosm when I am reassuredby ratio that the cube of my volumes is to the surfaces of their subjectsas the sphericity of these globes (I am very pressing for a parliamentarymotion this term which, under my guidance, would establish thedeleteriousness of decorousness in the morbidisation of the modernmandaboutwoman type) is to the feracity of Fairynelly's vacuum. I neednot anthrapologise for any obintentional (I must here correct all thatschool of neoitalian or paleoparisien schola of tinkers and spanglerswho say I'm wrong parcequeue out of revolscian from romanitis I wantto be) downtrodding on my foes. Professor Levi-Brullo, F.D. ofSexeWeiman-Eitelnaky finds, from experiments made by hinn with hisNuremberg eggs in the one hands and the watches cunldron apan theoven, though it is astensably a case of Ket's rebollions cooling the Popesback, because the number of squeer faiths in weekly circulation will notbe appreciably augmented by the notherslogging of my cupolar clods.What the romantic in rags pines after like all tomtompions hauntingcrevices for a deadbeat escupement and what het importunes our Mitleidfor in accornish with the Mortadarthella taradition is the poorestcommononguardiant waste of time.

When Mullockywon the couple of colds, when we were stripping in number three, Iwould like the neat drop that would malt in my mouth but I fail to seewhen (I am purposely refraining from expounding the obvious fallacy asto the specific gravitates of the two deglutables implied nor to the lapseslequou asousiated with the royal gorge through students of mixedhydrostatics and pneumodipsics will after some difficulties grappleaway with my meinungs). Myrrdin aloer! as old Marsellas Cambriannusputs his. But, on Professor Llewellys ap Bryllars, F.D., Ph. Dr'sshowings, the plea, if he pleads, is all posh and robbage on amelodeontic scale since his man's when is no otherman's quandour(Mine, dank you?) while, for aught I care for the contrary, the all iswhere in love as war andthe plane where me arts soar you'd aisy rouse athunder from and where I cling true'tis there I climb tree and whereInnocent looks best (pick!) there's holly in his ives.     As my explanations here are probably above your understandings,lattlebrattons, though as augmentatively uncomparisoned as Cadwan,Cadwallon and Cadwalloner, I shall revert to a more expletive methodwhich I frequently use when I have to sermo with muddlecrass pupils.Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed,goslingnecked, clothyheaded, tangled in your lacings, tingled in yourpants, etsitaraw etcicero. And you, Bruno Nowlan, take your tongue outof your inkpot! As none of you knows javanese I will give all myeasyfree translation of the old fabulist's parable. Allaboy Minor, takeyour head out of your satchel! Audi, Joe Peters! Exaudi facts!     The Mookse and The Gripes.     Gentes and laitymen, fullstoppers and semicolonials, hybreds andlubberds!     Eins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned aMookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval,and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo),so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supperof gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils,vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throats, he put on hisimpermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and steppedout of his immobile De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull ofmasterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas,pintacostecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Ludstowna spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensibleways.    As he set off with his father's sword, his lancia spezzata, he wasgirded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once inonly Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop,every inch of an immortal.    He had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his azyliumwhen at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran nearSaint Bowery's-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one one oneth of thepropecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the most unconsciouslyboggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens ittook a rise by daubing itself Ninon. It looked little and it smelt of brownand it thought in narrows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn itdribbled like any lively purliteasy: My, my, my! Me and me! Little downdream don't I love thee!    And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream thatwould be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but theGripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not beenhaving the juice of his times?    His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps werecharging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting thedresser's desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly forgiving the bailiff's distrain on to the bulkside of his cul de Pompe. In allhis specious heavings, as be lived by Optimus Maximus, the Mooksehad never seen his Dubville brooderon-low so nigh to a pickle.

And bullfolly answered volleyball.    Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was lookingdown on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all shechildishly could. How she was brightened when Shouldrups in hisglaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclusedwhen Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse ofhimshelp! She was alone. All her nubied companions were asleepingwith the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerstquarter scrubbing the backsteps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, hewas up in Norwood's sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking's Blemish.Nuvoletta listened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one withhis constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all shetried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore tooadiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she couldbe (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens toheed her) but it was all mild's vapour moist. Not even her feigntreflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their gnoses off for their mindswith intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved withHeliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever thecoordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubssaid. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate herqueendim! As if she would be third perty to search on searchproceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four windshad taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like la princessede la Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like MrsCornwallis-West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of theimage of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Emperour ofIrelande and she sighed after herself as were she bornto bride withTristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as wellhave carried her daisy's worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmadAccanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wispinefully obliviscent.    -- I see, she sighed. There are menner.    The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the vergrose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began toglidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and itwas as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacableworlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloroform brune; citherior spianean eaulande, innemorous and unnumerose. The Mookse had a soundeyes right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet hecould but ill see. He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it wasneversoever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deepsof the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Grifeeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.    Oh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina,dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears ofnight began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and fours, atlast by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were wecking, as weweep now with them. O! O! O! Par la pluie!    Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of noappearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and shegathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he wasspread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights,Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of herboshop's apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and youknew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank awoman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite thecold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker's hank,she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from hislimb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseenshieling, it is,De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; for that is alwayshow a Gripes is, always was and always will be. And it was never sothoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtreeand but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. O! Yes! AndNuvoletta, a lass.    Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life andshe made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled allher engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; she gave a childycloudy cry: Nu�e! Nu�e! A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And intothe river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone eonher and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and hermuddied name was Missisliffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, theloveliest of all tears (I mean for those crylove fables fans who are 'keen'on the prettypretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods)for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping asthough her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh I'se so silly tobe flowing but I no canna stay!    No applause, please! Bast!

The seemsame home and histry seeks and hidepence whichwe used to be reading for our prepurgatory, hot, Schott? till Duddy shutthe shopper op and Mutti, poor Mutti! brought us our poor suppy, (ahwho! eh how!) in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius Volatilis and PetrusPapricus!

Let me sell you the fulltroth of Burrus when hewore a younker. Here it is, and chorming too, in six by sevens! Acleanly line, by the gods! A king off duty and a jaw for ever!

This, of course, also explains why we were taught to play in thechildhood: Der Haensli ist ein Butterbrot, mein Butterbrot! Und Koebiiss dein Schtinkenkot! Ja! Ja! Ja!

Thus we cannot escape our likes and mislikes, exiles or ambusheers,beggar and neighbour and -- this is where the dimeshow advertisersadvance the temporal relief plea -- let us be tolerant of antipathies. Nexquovis burro num fit mercaseus? I am not hereby giving my finalendorsement to the learned ignorants of the Cusanus philosophism inwhich old Nicholas pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top thesounder the span of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste oughtto have meant was: the more stolidly immobile in space appears to methe bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primomobilisk&c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to give anunconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanustheory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart from hissheory wherethe Theophil swoors that on principial he was the pointing start of hisodiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all overthe walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.    Now, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintentionallyrecommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the moreeconomical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space tolook into it myself a little more closely first I shall go on with mydecisions after having shown to you in good time how both products ofour social stomach (the excellent Dr Burroman, I noticed by the wayfrom his emended food theory, has been carefully digesting the verywholesome criticismI helped him to in my princeps edition which is allso munch to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of anydelusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. Positing,as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omberthe Skotia of the one, and looking wantingly around our undistributedmiddle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female tofocus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M.whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us atsome precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero orthe babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son of a kishwho went up and out to found his farmer's ashes we come down homegently on our own turnedabout asses to meet Margareen.    We now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shamebredmusic (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of this subjecton a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevrehors) evidenced by such words in distress as I cream for thee, SweetMargareen, and the more hopeful O Margareena! O Margareena! Stillin the bowl is left a lump of gold! (Correspondents, by the way, willkeep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with.Tansy Sauce. Enough). The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of theseshoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus's bit is often usedfor a toast. Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and whythis particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) thebowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown,brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be usefullycompared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering this toSignorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it under thenosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his attentions. Of coursethe unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinatingthe space-element, that is to sing, the aria, to the time-factor, whichought to be killed, ill tempor. I should advise any unborn singer whomay still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm athome(the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade witha swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will insist wasreclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then,O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath andsee what spice I may send her. How? Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fainwould be solo. Arouse thee, my valour! And save for e'er my true Bdur!     I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic andorchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a vivariouswhere one plant's breaf is a lunger planner's byscent and you may notcare for argon, it will be very convenient for me for the emolument topursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelatingbiangle. Every admirer has seen my goulache of Marge (she is so likethe sister, you don't know, and they both dress A L I K E !) which Ititled The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman which in the presenceornates our national cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes ofmind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females soI am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the generalsuggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should thezulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes whichcomposed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her excelsis), alsocomprised the climactogram up which B and C may fondly be imaginedascending and are suggestive of gentlemen's spring modes, these modescarrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene andpleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in ourbody politic which Professor Ebahi-Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) --whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to -- neatlynames a bo�te � surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently,are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patentprocess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that ShedlockHomes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classicsby what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anythingunless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a slade off) afterwhich they can be reduced to a fragment of theirtrue crust by even theyoungest of Margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if Iplease.    Now there can be no question about it either that I having done asmuch, have quite got the size of that demilitery young female (we willcontinue to call her Marge) whose types may be met with in any publicgarden, wearing a very "dressy" affair, known as an "ethel" of insteplength and with a real fur, reduced to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (theyare "angelskin" this fall), ostentatiously hemming apologetically overthe shirtness of some "sweet" garment, when she is not sitting on all thefree benches avidously reading about "it" but ovidently on the look outfor "him" or so "thrilled" about the best dressed dolly pram andbeautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs andblowing bixed mixcuits over "childe" chaplain's "latest" or on the vergeof the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma's toddler (theSmythe-Smythes now keep TWO domestics and aspire to THREE maleones, a shover, a butlegger and a sectary) held hostage at armslength,teaching His Infant Majesty how to make waters worse.    (I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to suspectfrom my post that her "little man" is a secondary schoolteacher underthe boards of education, a voted disciple of Infantulus who is beingutilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own moremascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men's insideclothes, for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack themusculink of a verumvirum. My solotions for the proper parturience ofmatres and the education of micturious mites must stand over from themoment till I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)    Margareena she's very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! she vellyfond of chee. (The important influence exercised on everything by thiseastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we cancomfortably taste it in this case. I shall come back for a little more sayfarther on.) A cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates theposition while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery byimplicating her self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appearto hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same timeas he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This Antonius-Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalentwith the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in thehyperchemical economantarchy the tantum ergons irruminate thequantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like yourgolfchild's abe boob caddy.

He went without saying that the cull disliked anything anywayapproaching a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row and, asoften as he was called in to umpire any octagonal argument amongslangwhangers, the accomplished washout always used to rub shoulderswith the last speaker and clasp shakers (the handtouch which is speechwithout words) and agree to every word as soon as half uttered,command me!, your servant, good, I revere you, how, my seer? bedrinking that! quite truth, gratias, I'm yoush, see wha'm hearing?, alsogoods, please it, me sure?, be filling this!, quiso, you said it, apasafello,muchas grassyass, is there firing-on-me?, is their girlic-on-you?, to yourgood self, your sulphur, and then at once focuss his whole unbalancedattention upon the next octagonist who managed to catch a listener'seye, asking and imploring him out of his piteous onewinker,(hemoptysia diadumenos) whether there was anything in the world hecould do to please him and to overflow his tumbletantaliser for him yetonce more.

Two ladsin scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn andWallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia's noblesse pickts, before she had a hintof a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a birch canoedler notto mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And ere that again, leada, laida,all unraidy, too faint to buoy the fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with acygnet's plume, she was licked by a hound, Chirripa-Chirruta, whilepoing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, inbirdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wigglylivvly, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil's glen while Sally hernurse was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillwaybefore she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stagnantblack pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed innocefree withher limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden hawthorns blushing andlooking askance upon her.

Sure he hasn't got much of a bark   And sure any he has it's all beside the mark.   But O, Wreneagle Almighty, wouldn't un be a sky of a lark   To see that old buzzard whooping about for uns shirt in the dark   And he hunting round for uns speckled trousers around byPalmerstown Park?   Hohohoho, moulty Mark!   You're the rummest old rooster ever flopped out of a Noah's ark    And you think you're cock of the wark.    Fowls, up! Tristy's the spry young spark    That'll tread her and wed her and bed her and red her    Without ever winking the tail of a feather    And that's how that chap's going to make his money and mark!    Overhoved, shrillgleescreaming. That song sang seaswans. Thewinging ones. Seahawk, seagull, curlew and plover, kestrel andcapercallzie. All the birds of the sea they trolled out rightbold when theysmacked the big kuss of Trustan with Usolde.    And there they were too, when it was dark, whilest the wildcaps wascircling, as slow their ship, the winds aslight, upborne the fates, thewardorse moved, by courtesy of Mr Deaubaleau DownbellowKaempersally, listening in, as hard as they could, in Dubbeldorp, thedonker, by the tourneyold of the wattarfalls, with their vuoxens and theykemin in so hattajocky (only a quartebuck askull for the last acts) to thesolans and the sycamores and the wild geese and the gannets and themigratories and the mistlethrushes and the auspices and all the birds ofthe rockbysuckerassousyoceanal sea, all four of them, all sighing andsobbing, and listening. Moykle ahoykling!    They were the big four, the four maaster waves of Erin, all listening,four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old Matt there wasold Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes they used to besaying grace together, right enough, bausnabeatha, in Miracle Squeer:here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gregory and old Marcus andold Luke Tarpey: the four of us and sure, thank God, there are no moreof us: and, sure now, you wouldn't go and forget and leave out the otherfellow and old Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of usand so now pass the fish for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to besaying their grace before fish, repeating itself, after the interims ofAugusburgh for auld lang syne. And so there they were, with theirpalms in their hands, like the pulchrum's proculs, spraining their ears,luistening and listening to the oceans of kissening, with their eyesglistening, all the four, when he was kiddling and cuddling andbunnyhugging scrumptious his colleen bawn and dinkum belle, an oscarsister, on the fifteen inch loveseat, behind the chieftaness stewardessescubin, the hero, of Gaelic champion, the onliest one of her choice, herbleaueyedeal of a girl's friend, neither bigugly nor smallnice, meaningpretty much everything to her then, with his sinister dexterity, light andrufthandling, vicemversem her ragbags et assaucyetiams, fore and aft,on and offsides, the brueburnt sexfutter, handson and huntsem, that waspalpably wrong and bulbubly improper, and cuddling her and kissingher, tootyfay charmaunt, in her ensemble of maidenna blue, with anoverdress of net, tickled with goldies, Isolamisola, and whisping andlisping her about Trisolanisans, how one was whips for one was two andtwo was lips for one was three, and dissimulating themself, with hispoghue like Arrah-na-poghue, the dear dear annual, they all fourremembored who made the world and how they used to be at that timein the vulgar ear cuddling and kiddling her, after an oyster supper inCullen's barn, from under her mistlethrush and kissing and listening, inthe good old bygone days of Dion Boucicault, the elder, in Arrah-napogue, in the otherworld of the passing of the key of TwotongueCommon, with Nush, the carrier of the word, and with Mesh, the cutterof the reed, in one of the farback, pitchblack centuries when who madethe world, when they knew O'Clery, the man on the door, when theywere all four collegians on the nod, neer the Nodderlands Nurskery,whiteboys and oakboys, peep of tim boys and piping tom boys, raisinghell while the sin was shining, with their slates and satchels, playingFlorian's fables and communic suctions and vellicar frictions withmixum members, in the Queen's Ultonian colleges, along with anotherfellow, a prime number, Totius Quotius, and paying a pot of tribluts toBoris O'Brien, the buttler of Clumpthump, two looves, two turnoversplus (one) crown, to see the mad dane ating his vitals. Wulf! Wulf! Andthrowing his tongue in the snakepit. Ah ho! The ladies have mercias! Itbrought the dear prehistoric scenes all back again, as fresh as of yore,Matt and Marcus, natural born lovers of nature, in all her moves andsenses, and after that now there he was, that mouth of mandibles, vowedto pure beauty, and his Arrah-na-poghue, when she murmurously, aftershe let a cough, gave her firm order, if he wouldn't please mind, for asings to one hope a dozen of the best favourite lyrical national bloomsin Luvillicit, though not too much, reflecting on the situation, drinkingin draughts of purest air serene and revelling in the great outdoors,before the four of them, in the fair fine night, whilst the stars shinebright, by she light of he moon, we longed to be spoon, before herhoneyoldloom, the plaint effect being in point of fact there being in thewhole, a seatuition so shocking and scandalous and now, thank God,there were no more of them and he poghuing and poghuing like theMoreigner bowed his crusted hoed and Tilly the Tailor's Tugged a Tarin the Arctic Newses Dagsdogs number and there they were, like aforemasters in the rolls, listening, to Rolando's deepen darblun Ossianroll, (Lady, it was just too gorgeous, that expense of a lovely tint,embellished by the charms of art and very well conducted and nicelymannered and all the horrid rudy noisies locked up in nasty cubbyhole!)as tired as they were, the three jolly topers, with their mouths watering,all the four, the old connubial men of the sea, yambing around with theirold pantometer, in duckasaloppics, Luke and Johnny MacDougall andall wishening for anything at all of the bygone times, the wald times andthe fald times and the hempty times and the dempty times, for a cup ofkindness yet, for four farback tumblerfuls of woman squash, with them,all four, listening and spraining their ears for the millennium and alltheir mouths making water.     Johnny. Ah well, sure, that's the way (up) and it so happened therewas poor Matt Gregory (up), their pater familias, and (up) the others andnow really and (up) truly they were four dear old heladies and reallythey looked awfully pretty and so nice and bespectable and after thatthey had their fathomglasses to find out all the fathoms and their half atall hat, just now like the old Merquus of Pawerschoof, the olddetermined despot, (quiescents in brage!) only for the extrusion of thesaltwater or the auctioneer there dormont, in front of the place nearO'Clery's, at the darkumound numbur wan, beside that ancient Damestreet, where the statue of Mrs Dana O'Connell, prostituent behind theTrinity College, that arranges all the auctions of the valuable colleges,Bootersbay    Sisters,  like  the   auctioneer  Battersby   Sisters, theprumisceous creaters, that sells all the emancipated statues andflowersports, James H.

But now, talking of hayastdanars and wolkingologyand how our seaborn isle came into exestuance, (the explutor, his threeandesiters and the two pantellarias) that reminds me about themanausteriums of the poor Marcus of Lyons and poor Johnny, thepatrician, and what do you think of the four of us and there they werenow, listening right enough, the four saltwater widowers, and all theycould remembore, long long ago in the olden times Momonian, throwdarker hour sorrows, the princest day, when Fair Margrate waitedSwede Villem, and Lally in the rain, with the blank prints, now extincts,after the wreak of Wormans' Noe, the barmaisigheds, when my heartknew no care, and after that then there was the official landing of LadyJales Casemate, in the year of the flood 1132 S.O.S., and the christeningof Queen Baltersby, the Fourth Buzzersbee, according to Her Grace thebishop Senior, off the whate shape, and then there was the drowning ofPharoah and all his pedestrians and they were all completely drownedinto the sea, the red sea, and then poor Merkin Cornyngwham, theofficial out of the castle on pension, when he was completely drownedoff Erin Isles, at that time, suir knows, in the red sea and a lovelymourning paper and thank God, as Saman said, there were no more ofhim.

There's no sabbath for nomads and I mostly was able to walk,being too soft for work proper, sixty odd eilish mires a week betweenthree masses a morn and two chaplets at eve.

By the wag, how is Mr Fry? All of it, I might say, in ex-voto, pay and perks and wooden halfpence, some rhino, rhine, O joyoustrhine, was handled over spondaneously by me (and bundle end to myillwishers' Miss Anders! she woor her wraith of ruins the night she lost Ileft!) in the ligname of Mr van Howten of Tredcastles, Clowntalkin,timbreman, among my prodigits nabobs and navious of everysubscription entitled the Bois in the Boscoor, our evicted tenemants.What I say is (and I am noen roehorn or culkilt permit me to tell you, ifuninformed), I never spont it.

He had eaten all the whilepaper, swallowed the lustres, devouredforty flights of styearcases, chewed up all the mensas and seccles,ronged the records, made mundballs of the ephemerids and vorasiousedmost glutinously with the very timeplace in the ternitary - not too dustya cicada of neutriment for a chittinous chip so mitey. But whenChrysalmas    was   on    the   bare    branches,    off  he   went    fromTingsomingenting. He took a round stroll and he took a stroll round andhe took a round strollagain till the grillies in his head and the leivnits inhis hair made him thought he had the Tossmania. Had he twicycled thesees of the deed and trestraversed their revermer? Was he come to hevrewith his engiles or gone to hull with the poop? The June snows wasflocking in thuckflues on the hegelstomes, millipeeds of it andmyriopoods, and a lugly whizzling tournedos, the Boraborayellers,blohablasting tegolhuts up to tetties and ruching sleets off thecoppeehouses, playing ragnowrock rignewreck, with an irritant,penetrant, siphonopterous spuk.

Behailed His Gross the Ondt, prostrandvorous upon hisdhrone, in his Papylonian babooshkees, smolking a spatial brunt ofHosana cigals, with unshrinkables farfalling from his unthinkables,swarming of himself in his sunnyroom, sated before his comfortumblephullupsuppy of a plate o'monkynous and a confucion of minthe (for hewas a conformed aceticist and aristotaller), as appi as a oneysucker or abaskerboy on the Libido, with Floh biting his leg thigh and Luselugging his luff leg and Bieni bussing him under his bonnet andVespatilla blowing cosy fond tutties up the allabroad length of the largeof his smalls.

Emmet anddemmet and be jiltses crazed and be jadeses whipt! schneezed theGracehoper, aguepe with ptchjelasys and at his wittol's indts, what haveeyeforsight!    The Ondt, that true and perfect host, a spiter aspinne, was makingthe greatest spass a body could with his queens laceswinging for he wasspizzing all over him like thingsumanything in formicolation,boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of houris. He was ameisinghimself hugely at crabround and marypose, chasing Floh out of charityand tickling Luse, I hope too, and tackling Bienie, faith, as well, andjucking Vespatilla jukely by the chimiche. Never did Dorsan fromDunshanagan dance it with more devilry! The veripatetic imago of theimpossible Gracehoper on his odderkop in the myre, after his thriceephemeral journeeys, sans mantis ne shooshooe, featherweighedanimule, actually and presumptuably sinctifying chronic's despair, wassufficiently and probably coocoo much for his chorous of gravitates.

The thing pleased him andt, and andt,   He larved ond he larved on he merd such a nauses   The Gracehoper feared he would mixplace his fauces.   I forgive you, grondt Ondt, said the Gracehoper, weeping,   For their sukes of the sakes you are safe in whose keeping.

Shaun replied under the sheltar of his broguish,vigorously rubbing his magic lantern to a glow of fullconsciousness.HeCitEncy! Your words grates on my ares. Notorious I rather wouldfeel inclined to myself in the first place to describe Mr O'Shem theDraper with before letter as should I be accentually called upon for adieoguinnsis to pass my opinions, properly spewing, into impulsoryirelitz. But I would not care to be so unfruitful to my own part as toswear for the moment positively as to the views of Denmark. No, sah!But let me say my every belief before my high Gee is that I much doubtof it. I've no room for that fellow on my fagroaster, I just can't. As Ihourly learn from Rooters and Havers through Gilligan's maypoles in anice pathetic notice he, the pixillated doodler, is on his last with illegibleclergimanths boasting always of his ruddy complexious! She, themammy far, was put up to it by him, the iniquity that ought to bedepraved of his libertins to be silenced, sackclothed and suspended, andplaced in irons into some drapyery institution off the antipopees forwordsharping only if he was klanver enough to pass the panelfleischcurers and the fieldpost censor. Gach! For that is a fullblown factand well celibated before the four divorce courts and all the King'spaunches, how he has the solitary from seeing Scotch snakes and has alowsense for the production of consumption and dalickey cyphalos onhis brach premises where he can purge his contempt and dejeunerateinto a skillyton be thinking himself to death. Rot him! Flannelfeet!Flattyro! I will describe you in a word. Thou. (I beg your pardon.)Homo! Then putting his bedfellow on me! (like into mike and nick ontopost).

Aham!     - May we petition you, Shaun illustrious, then, to put his prentis'pride in your aproper's purse and to unravel in your own sweet way withwords of style to your very and most obsequient, we suggested, with yetan esiop's foible, as to how?     - Well it is partly my own, isn't it? and you may, ought andwelcome, Shaun replied, taking at the same time, as his hunger got thebitter of him, a hearty bite out of the honeycomb of his Braham andMelosedible hat, tryone, tryon and triune.

All about Wucherer and righting his name forhim. I regret to announce, after laying out his litterery bed, for two daysshe kept squealing down for noisy priors and bawling out to herjameymock farceson in Shemish like a mouther of the incas with agarcielasso huw Ananymus pinched her tights and about the Balt withthe markshaire parawag and his loyal divorces, when he feraxiouslyshed ovas in Alemaney, tse tse, all the tell of the tud with thebourighevisien backclack, and him, the cribibber like an ambitrickster,aspiring like the decan's, fast aslooped in the intrance to hispolthronechair with his sixth finger between his catseye and the index,making his pillgrimace of Childe Horrid, engrossing to his ganderpanwhat the idioglossary he invented under hicks hyssop!

It was given meeck, thank the Bench, toassist at the whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as Ithink of that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cuttingmy prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the jawache! Beme punting his reflection he'd begin his beogrefright in muddyassribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef! You know he's peculiar, thateggschicker, with the smell of old woman off him, to suck nothing ofhis switchedupes. M.D. made his ante mortem for him. He was grey atthree, like sygnus the swan, when he made his boo to the public andbarnacled up to the eyes when he repented after seven. The alum thatwinters on his top is the stale of the staun that will soar when hestambles till that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He wasdown with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason thewhopping first time he prediseased me. He's weird, I tell you, andmiddayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls feet and histanbark complexion. That's why he was forbidden tomate and waswarmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under the Helpless CorpsesEnactment. I'm not at all surprised the saint kicked him whereby thesum taken Berkeley showed the reason genrously. Negas, negasti         -negertop, negertoe, negertoby, negrunter! Then he was pusched out ofThingamuddy's school by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught theeuropicolas and went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls andFran Czeschs and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos. One temp when hefoiled to be killed, the freak wanted to put his bilingual headintentionally through the Ikish Tames and go and join the clericy as ademonican skyterrier. Throwing dust in the eyes of the Hooley Fermers!He used to be avowdeed as he ought to be vitandist. For onced Isqueaked by twyst I'll squelch him.

Upu now!     - Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the muttermelk ofhis blood donor beginning to work, and while innocent of disseminatingthe foul emanation, it would be a fall day I could not, sole, so you cankeep your space and by the power of blurry wards I am loyable to do it(I am convicted of it!) any time ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me bootallowance!) with the allergrossest transfusiasm as, you see, while I cansoroquise the Siamanish better than most, it is an openear secret, be itsaid, how I am extremely ingenuous at the clerking even with my badilyleft and, arrah go braz, I'd pinsel it with immenuensoes as easy as I'dperorate a chickerow of beans for the price of two maricles and mytrifolium librotto, the authordux Book of Lief, would, if given todaylight, (I hold a most incredible faith about it) far exceed what thatbogus bolshy of a shame, my soamheis brother, Gaoy Fecks, isconversant with in audible black and prink.

And next thing was he gummalicked the stickyback side andstamped the oval badge of belief to his agnelows brow with a genuinedash of irrepressible piety that readily turned his ladylike typmanzellescapsy curvy (the holy scamp!), with half a glance of Irish frisky (a JuanJaimesan hastaluego) from under the shag of his parallel brows.

On the meadof the hillock lay, heartsoul dormant mid shadowed landshape, briefwallet to his side, and arm loose, by his staff of citron briar, traditionstick-pass-on. His dream monologue was over, of cause, but his dramaparapolylogic had yet to be, affact. Most distressfully (but, my dear,how successfully!) to wail he did, his locks of a lucan tinge, quickrich,ripely rippling, unfilleted, those lashbetasselled lids on the verge ofclosing time, whiles ouze of his sidewiseopen mouth the breath of him,evenso languishing as the princeliest treble treacle or lichee chewchowpurse could buy. Yawn in a semiswoon lay awailing and (hooh!) whathelpings of honeyful swoothead (phew!), which earpiercing dulcitude!As were you suppose to go and push with your bluntblank pin in handupinto his fleshasplush cushionettes of some chubby boybold love of anangel. Hwoah!    When, as the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the home firesburning, so on the churring call themselves came at him, from thewestborders of the eastmidlands, three kings of three suits and acrowner, from all their cardinal parts, along the amber way whereBrosna's furzy. To lift them they did, senators four, by the first quaintskreek of the gloaming and they hopped it up the mountainy molehill,traversing climes of old times gone by of the days not worthremembering; inventing some excusethems, any sort, having a sevenplysweat of night blues moist upon them. Feefee! phopho!! foorchtha!!!aggala!!!!    jeeshee!!!!!  paloola!!!!!!   ooridiminy!!!!!!!   Afearedthemselves were to wonder at the class of a crossroads puzzler he wouldlikely be, length by breadth nonplussing his thickness, ells upon ells ofhim, making so many square yards of him, one half of him in Conn'shalf but the whole of him nevertheless in Owenmore's five quarters.There would he lay till they would him descry, spancelled down upon ablossomy bed, at one foule stretch, amongst the daffydowndillies, theflowers of narcosis fourfettering his footlights, a halohedge of wildspuds hovering over him, epicures waltzing with gardenfillers, puritanshoots advancing to Aran chiefs. Phopho!! The meteor pulp of him, theseamless rainbowpeel. Aggala!!!! His bellyvoid of nebulose with hisneverstop navel. Paloola!!!!!! And his veins shooting melanitephosphor, his creamtocustard cometshair and his asteroid knuckles, ribsand members. Ooridiminy!!!!!!! His electrolatiginous twisted entrailsbelt.    Those four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn starchamberquiry on him. For he was ever their quarrel, the way they would seethemselves, everybug his bodiment atop of annywom her notion, andthe meet of their noght was worth two of his morning. Up to the eskerridge it was, Mallinger parish, to a mead that was not far, the son's rest.First klettered Shanator Gregory, seeking spoor through the deeptimefield, Shanator Lyons, trailing the wavy line of his partitionfootsteps (something in his blisters was telling him all along how he hadbeen in that place one time), then his Recordership, Dr ShunadureTarpey, caperchasing after honourable sleep, hot on to the aniseed and,up out of his prompt corner, old Shunny MacShunny, MacDougal thehiker, in the rere of them on the run, to make a quorum. Roping their asshe was, their skygrey globetrotter, by way of an afterthought and by nomeans legless either for such sprouts on him they were that muchoneven it was tumbling he was by four lengths, within the bawl of amascot, kuss yuss, kuss cley, patsy watsy, like the kapr in the kabisses,the big ass, to hear with his unaided ears the harp in the air, the bugledianablowing, wild as wild, the mockingbird whose word is misfortune,so 'tis said, the bulbul down the wind.    The proto was traipsing through the tangle then, Mathew Walker,godsons' goddestfar, deputising for gossipocracy, and his station was afew perch to the weatherside of the knoll Asnoch and it was from noother place unless there, how and ever, that he proxtended aloof uponthe ether Mesmer's Manuum, the hand making silence. The buckosbeyond on the lea, then stopped wheresoever they found their standingsand that way they set ward about him, doing obedience, nod, bend, bowand curtsey, like the watchers of Prospect, upholding their broadawakeprober's hats on their firrum heads, the travelling court on its findingscircuiting that personer in his fallen. And a crack quatyouare ofstenoggers they made of themselves, solons and psychomorers, all told,with their hurts and daimons, spites and clops, not even to the seclusionof their beast by them that was the odd trick of the pack, trump and nofriend of carrots. And, what do you think, who should be laying thereabove all other persons forenenst them only Yawn! All of asprawl hewas laying too amengst the poppies and, I can tell you something morethan that, drear writer, profoundly as you may bedeave to it, he wasoscasleep asleep. And it was far more similar to a satrap he lay therewith unctuous beauty all surrounded, the poser, or for whatall I knowlike Lord Lumen, coaching his preferred constellations in faith anddoctrine, for old Matt Gregory, 'tis he had the starmenagerie, MarcusLyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack that never forgave theass that lurked behind him, Jonny na Hossaleen.    More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled youwould say themselves were, fuming censor, the way they could notrightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched down amamalujo by his cubical crib, as question time drew nighing and themap of the souls' groupography rose in relief within their quarterings, toplay tops or kites or hoops or marbles, curchycurchy, gawking on him,for the issuance of his pnum and softnoising one of them to another one,the boguaqueesthers.    And it is what they began to say to him tetrahedrally then, themasters, what way was he.    -- He's giving, the wee bairn. Yun has lived.    -- Yerra, why dat, my leader?    -- Wisha, is he boosed or what, alannah?    -- Or his wind's from the wrong cut, says Ned of the Hill.    -- Lesten!    -- Why so and speak up, do you hear me, you sir?    -- Or he's rehearsing somewan's funeral.    -- Whisht outathat! Hubba's up!    And as they were spreading abroad on their octopuds their drifternets, the chromous gleamy seiners' nets and, no lie, there was word ofassonance being softspoken among those quartermasters.    -- Get busy, kid!    -- Chirpy, come now!    -- The present hospices is a good time.    -- I'll take on that chap.    For it was in the back of their mind's ear, temptive lissomer, howthey would be spreading in quadriliberal their azurespotted fineattractable nets, their nansen nets, from Matt Senior to the thurriblemystagogue after him and from thence to the neighbour and that way tothe puisny donkeyman and his crucifer's cauda. And in their minds yearsbackslibris, so it was, slipping beauty, how they would be meshing thatway, when he rose to it, with the planckton at play about him, thequivers of scaly silver and their clutches of chromes of the highly lucidspanishing gold whilst, as hour gave way to mazing hour, with Yawnhimself keeping time with his thripthongue, to ope his blurbeous lips hewould, a let out classy, the way myrrh of the moor and moltenmoonmist would be melding mellifond indo his mouth.    -- Y?    -- Before You!    -- Ecko!

Only it was turniphuddeddunce, I beg your pardon, and he would jokes bowlderblow thebetholder with his black masket off the bawling green.   -- Sublime was the warning!   -- The author, in fact, was mardred.   -- Did he, the first spikesman, do anything to him, the lastspokesman, when, after heaving some more smutt and chaff betweenthem, they rolled togutter into the ditch together?

You did, you rogue, you?    -- You hear things. Besides (and serially now) bushes have eyes,don't forget. Hah!    -- Which moral turpitude would you select of the two, for choice, ifyou had your way? Playing bull before shebears or the hindlegs off aclotheshorse? Did any orangepeelers or greengoaters appear periodicallyup your sylvan family tree?    -- Buggered if I know! It all depends on how much family silveryou want for a nass-and-pair. Hah!    -- What do you mean, sir, behind your hah! You don't hah to dothah, you know, snapograph.    -- Nothing, sir. Only a bone moving into place. Blotogaff. Hahah!    -- Whahat?    -- Are you to have all the pleasure quizzing on me? I didn't say italoud, sir.

Honuphrius is a concupiscent exservicemajor who makes dis honestpropositions to all. He is considered to have committed, invoking droitd'oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practisingfor unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere mias, two or threephiladelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias areconsanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita the wife of Honophrius, hasbeen told by her tirewoman, For tissa, that Honuphrius hasblasphemously confessed under volun tary chastisement that he hasinstructed his slave, Mauritius, to urge Magravius, a commercial,emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita isinformed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with Mauritius (thesupposition is Ware's) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, isvisited clandes tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, animmoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a coolerblend, D'Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara,Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday'sview), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita hasformerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, aperpetual curate, who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatensto have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of aband of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procureFelicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators,if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren deringconjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have discoveredincestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius would yield to thelewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and themercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, and (as Gilbert at firstsuggested), to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius whenconverted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that, byallowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conductbetween Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauchedAnita, dispen ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretendspublicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter!affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for carnal hygiene wheneverhe has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anitais disturbed but Michael comminates that he will reserve her casetomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise apious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows(according to Wadding), to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, isencouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly,to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius andthe depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife ofMauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Hashe hegemony and shall she submit?    Translate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape andChattertone, deceased.    This, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of allcases arising out of umbrella history in connection with the woodindustries in our courts of litigation. D'Oyly Owens holds (though FinnMagnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint depositaccount in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens citesBrerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered asTangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The actionwhich was at the instance of the trustee of the heathen churchemergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the payment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com monjury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spokevolumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective.The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun dus Coppercheap,counterclaimed that payment was invalid having been tendered tocreditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course,in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls Cross, voucher copy provided, anddrawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the specieshad been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, thenational misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chiefbondholders for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though therewere ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trustyCoppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to aclient of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received inexchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks.Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em bossed D you D No 11hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulatingin the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, arival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun orfluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquidcash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiouslynamed after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and thebelligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors' disagree ment, wentoutside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar nishee attachment tothe neutral firm. No mandamus could lo cate the depleted whilomBreyfawkes as he had entered into an ancient moratorium, dating backto the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren couldbe found, who entered an appearance and turned up, upon a notice ofmotion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction,among the male jurors to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from theproletarian class, with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2Coppinger's Cottages, the Doyle's country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in,having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the standin a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy lish, that she hadoften, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point,discounted Mr Brakeforth's first of all in ex change at nine months fromdate without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberationa current account of how she had been made at sight for servicesrendered the payee drawee of unwashable blank assignations,sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the cr�me-de-citron, vair �mail paon coque or marshmallow series, which she, asbearer, used to en dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers whoin most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknowntetigists of the city and suburban.
