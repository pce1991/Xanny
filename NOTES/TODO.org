* Tasks
** TEXTS
*** TO DO
**** TODO read maps from files
**** TODO allow optional index of length 5? use nesting?
**** TODO map verse in sentence-based text
**** TODO search for phrase in one or more texts
***** TODO search by "contains", grammer, subject
**** TODO deal with texts containing a lot of junk, like PDFs
     detect repeated lines like title/author headers
**** TODO Build UI for navigating/comparing.
     come up with a lot of shortcuts. 
     use printf or format for console comparison. Line things up like this.
	 xlansaho htaoe uh h atoheun ha saos oennte
	 htnao hteno assssr,c.p mntsntogr ";htneoas"	htneoas ahhoh ehho ah o
	 aoeuhnaoseunonuh ao a o b sabs ;r u baoeu	htnasoeutnhaoesnuthaoeu
    so that the liked text begins where it's referenced, then continues through a certain point, so you could say you only want the context of the line, or the rest of the chapter.
**** TODO analyze text to determine how to map
     check repeating patterns that aren't sentences. check justification
**** TODO map websters dict
**** TODO word hyphenation/syllabification
     what are the difeerences? use split to get vector of syllables to count.
**** TODO begin using wordnet to find meaning
**** TODO summarize texts
**** TODO Markov generator
    this leads to an advertisement generator. use wordnet! something like 
"you are a attribute." "Be a concept." "intensifier quality"
**** TODO Map Shakespeare
***** first, split up the file into 1 for each play so I dont have to do 5th index. easy way out?
**** TODO add metadata to maps
     things like: section-mapped? line/sentence-based segments.
**** TODO mark data by time, train in chronological order
**** TODO read text to find the proper index count so it isnt static
     might mess with retrieval functions since seg won't asways take same # of args
**** TODO retain lyrics in sentence mapping, check justified?
     sometims they,re just indented. also, deal with letters in Ulysses, and the play.
     letters begin with a name, a body, and then farewell; beginning and end are indented.
     make sure to preserve spaces in mapping, or else map-sentences won't know.
*** FOR CONSEDERATION
**** TODO find segments of a text! this migh be easier than the marker method. 
     deal with them as if it were a book.
**** dont clean up a string until that data has been used in all mapping
*** ISSUES
**** "quotes like this" --by me are mapped as two different sentences.
     this sucks because quotes should be considered a whole unit, or at least be contextualized
**** sometimes consecutive linebreaks mean something. dont fight it.
***** this in the case in Finnegan's Wake where each sentence is 1 line apart but paragraphs are 2
