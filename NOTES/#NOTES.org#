* NOTES
** Research
*** Language generation
*** Information extraction
    what are the key categories to extract out of a text? varies based
    on subject.
** Mechanics
*** Dialogue
    this is a stretch, but I'd like some interaction with
    xanny. There's an excuse for her inability to understand you
    sometimes.
** Vaguery
*** mapping texts
    should I give this up and find an easier way to use text data. look into xml, 
but it isn't as ubiquitous.
*** look into deftype and defrecord
